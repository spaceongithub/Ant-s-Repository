    "So what exactly is pandas-- other than a cute bear endemic to China?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas sits ontop of of an engine, a package called Numpy, which is an awesome, very fast package for analyzaing data. Panda takes all the power of NumPy, but it wraps it up in this user-friendly package. It gives us higher level tools that can do all of the things that we commonly do with data. A lot of the syntax for pandas was actually inspired by R.  R is a very data-oriented language. So the syntax really emphasizes functional programming. It leads to very clean, very explicit code that really makes clear all of the operations that we want to perform on data. Pandas has several core types that you need to become familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An Index\n",
    "2. A Series\n",
    "3. A Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, there is an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is the way that we label the data. It's how we access different observations within our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a series-- It represents a single column of data. It has an index, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this could represent something like a variable-- maybe a list of measurements that we have. \n",
    "\n",
    "And then, finally, we have a data frame. A data frame is a combination of multiple series. It also has an index. And this is very much like a data table. This is the usual way in which we'll represent a data set that we're analyzing. So typically, every column in a data frame will represent a variable, and every roll will be an observation for our set of variables, or a unit of analysis. So the key to learning about pandas-- remember that it sits on top of NumPy, so it's very fast, it's very efficient. Now, as you're learning pandas, there's going to be some syntax and operations to get used to, so please be patient. But as you're asking questions, try to express your questions using the vocabulary of pandas so that you can get used to the pandas way of thinking about data."

    "I'll go ahead and run the imports and get an import NumPy; pandas, which we typically import as PD; and then to do a little bit of plotting at the end, I'm also going to import this plotting library which is matplotlib. And here is a little magic command that lets the plots that we create appear right here in the notebook. So we won't worry about that too much right at the moment because I really mainly want to focus on pandas."

So you can think of the indexes as really a way to keep track of what each value means, even as you're doing complicated operations that may rearrange your rows of data. Or maybe you extend the series or lose some data within the series. This is a way that you can make sure that you always know the meaning behind each of these values. So sometimes that can be useful. Other times you may not use the index very much at all. Sometimes when I code I don't really pay attention to the index. And it really depends on your coding style."

Actually, axis is really common in a lot of Python methods, in a lot of pandas methods. You're going to have to set the axis argument."

So maybe I want the midterm on the x, and I have to tell it what I want on the y-axis, and maybe the final on the y-axis, and you can see that was really nice and easy. I have this great scatterplot just for, you know-- because it's such an important practice, I'm going to go ahead and give it title.\n",
