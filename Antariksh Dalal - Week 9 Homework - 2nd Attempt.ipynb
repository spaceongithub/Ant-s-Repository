      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for taking time on \n",
      "your holiday.  The purpose of this meeting is to update the Committee on financial developments \n",
      "over the weekend and to consider whether we want to take a policy action today.  I would like to \n",
      "start with a brief update on the markets from Bill Dudley and take any questions for him, and \n",

      "MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our videoconference on \n",
      "January 9, the market functioning in terms of the bank term funding markets has \n",
      "generally continued to improve, with the one-month and three-month LIBOR relative \n",
      "to the overnight index swap rates coming back very sharply.  They are now as narrow \n",
      "as they’ve been since the market turmoil began.  But elsewhere in terms of market \n",
      "functioning, we started to see a step backward last week—e specially late in the \n",
      "week—when we viewed the asset -backed commercial paper market beginning to \n",
      "deteriorate again, and there was some flight to quality into the Treasury bill market \n",
      "late last week. \n",
      " \n",
      " More important, the macro outlook and broader financial market conditions \n",
      "have continued to deteriorate quite sharply.  The S&P 500 index, for example, fell \n",
      "5.4 percent last week; it is down almost 10 percent so far this year.  Today it fell \n",
      "another 60 points, or 4.5 percent, so that means that the cumulative decline in the \n",
      "S&P 500, if it opens near where the futures markets closed today, will be nearly \n",
      "15 percent since the start of the year.  Global stock markets were also down very \n",
      "sharply today—Mo nday.  Depending on where you look, the range of decline was \n",
      "anywhere from 3 percent to 7½ percent, pretty much across the board.  Corporate \n",
      "credit spreads and credit default spreads have continued to widen, and bank mark-to-\n",
      "market losses and loan-loss provisions keep increasing.  The Merrill Lynch and \n",
      "Citigroup earnings announcements last week generally suggested a widening in terms \n",
      "of the scope of losses, not just in subprime but also in terms of credit card receivables \n",
      "and other loans. \n",
      " \n",
      "  A newish wrinkle here in terms of bank markdowns reflects the deterioration of \n",
      "some of the monoline guarantors.  Merrill Lynch, for example, announced a \n",
      "multibillion dollar charge for its exposure to ACA, which is the most impaired of the \n",
      "monoline guarantors.  The other monoline guarantors are in better shape, but they’ve \n",
      "either been downgraded, such as the case of Ambac by Fitch on Friday afternoon, or \n",
      "are under review for being downgraded by a number of different credit-rating \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "3 of 32agencies.  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising capital has \n",
      "become much more difficult.  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent \n",
      "surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar.  It’s not clear \n",
      "how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating.  The goal posts keep \n",
      "moving.  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates on subprime mortgages about a \n",
      "week and a half ago, and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms of \n",
      "their capital adequacy.   \n",
      " \n",
      "So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional \n",
      "capital soon, further rating downgrades seem very, very likely.  This has three \n",
      "potential consequences that are noteworthy.  First, in the money market space, a \n",
      "number of money market products are wrapped by the monoline guarantors, including \n",
      "variable-rate demand notes, auction-rate securities, and tender option bonds.  Some of \n",
      "these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over, they’ll \n",
      "go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets.  For those \n",
      "without liquidity support, either they will be converted to longer-dated securities, \n",
      "which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or the dealers will \n",
      "have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing.  A second \n",
      "consequence from monoline guarantor downgrades would be to the municipal bond \n",
      "funds.  The loss of AAA insurance raises the question of what the retail bond \n",
      "investors do.  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty \n",
      "calm on that front.  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major \n",
      "muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week.  So there are no \n",
      "signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully, given the fact that \n",
      "only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late \n",
      "last week.  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the value of the \n",
      "guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen.  In contrast, the monolines \n",
      "don’t have to mark to market.  Downgrading the monolines frontloads the hit to \n",
      "capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because market \n",
      "valuations can overshoot.  So it is not trivial to transfer this risk from the monolines \n",
      "to the financial institutions given the distinction that the monolines do not have to \n",
      "mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do. \n",
      " \n",
      "At this point, monetary policy expectations have priced in a lot of easing over the \n",
      "near term.  As of Friday’s close, there were about 67 basis points priced in through \n",
      "the January meeting at the end of the month and about 110 basis points priced in \n",
      "through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract).  \n",
      "There is likely more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that \n",
      "we saw today.  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed.  I’ll be happy to \n",
      "take any questions, of course. \n",
      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker? \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I \n",
      "didn’t quite get that. \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "4 of 32MR. DUDLEY.  The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences \n",
      "of the deterioration in, say, the structured-finance product they insured.  All they have to do is \n",
      "pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured-finance product can’t pay out.  So their \n",
      "losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time.  There is no sort of \n",
      "foreshortening of all that into the present.  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded \n",
      "and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to \n",
      "write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee.  So it’s \n",
      "quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline \n",
      "guarantors to the financial institutions that bought that insurance. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  President Hoenig. \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be \n",
      "saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would \n",
      "appreciate just his sense of things. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere \n",
      "around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up \n",
      "to now had performed pretty well.  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a \n",
      "very long time.  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger \n",
      "than the declines that we saw in Asia.  For example, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index, which is \n",
      "an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday.  The market went \n",
      "down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it came sharply down \n",
      "again at the close.  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day.  \n",
      "Bond markets reacted as you might expect.  Bond markets rallied as people became more \n",
      "pessimistic about the stock market.  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk-\n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "5 of 32aversion behavior.  The euro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen \n",
      "appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites.   \n",
      "I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe.  I didn’t really feel as though \n",
      "my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantors.  That was part of the \n",
      "story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t \n",
      "going to happen to the degree that we hoped.  Also, part of the story was that the risks of \n",
      "recession in the United States were increasing.  So financial guarantors got part of the blame for \n",
      "the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue \n",
      "here.  I was reluctant to call this meeting, both because of the holiday and because the \n",
      "Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled \n",
      "meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9.  However, I think there are times when \n",
      "events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting.  I know it is only a week \n",
      "away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets.  As Bill described, over the \n",
      "holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe.  As he \n",
      "mentioned, even though the U.S. markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today, \n",
      "close to 5 percent.  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC \n",
      "meeting 16½ percent.  Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock \n",
      "investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the \n",
      "economy and increasing problems in credit markets. \n",
      "On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets \n",
      "reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession.  \n",
      "Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "6 of 32have global consequences.  Consequently, we saw, for example, an 8 percent drop today in the \n",
      "German stock market.  The dollar rose today, reflecting I think increasing belief that other \n",
      "central banks will have to follow us in cutting rates, and oil prices are down to about $87, \n",
      "reflecting expectations of slowing global demand.  So it is not necessarily a U.S.-only story. \n",
      "On the financial side, as Bill noted, a lot of things are going on.  The latest is the likely \n",
      "downgrade of one or more of the monoline insurers, which would cause banks and other \n",
      "financial institutions to have to mark down billions more of their holdings.  I think there is a \n",
      "general sense— I certainly feel in talking to market participants—that it is not just subprime \n",
      "anymore and that there are real concerns about other kinds of consumer credit—c redit cards, \n",
      "autos, and home equity loans—and that there is fear of housing prices falling enough that \n",
      "contagion will infect prime mortgage loans.  There is building in the market a real dynamic of \n",
      "withdrawal from risk, withdrawal from normal credit extension, which I think is very worrisome. \n",
      "Would a rate action today, before the start of trading tomorrow, be of help?  I don’t \n",
      "know.  In some sense it was a lucky break that today was a holiday because in the middle of the \n",
      "day we got a very good read on what the markets are doing tomorrow, and so we can get ahead \n",
      "of things as opposed to being forced, after a couple of disastrous days, to respond.  Again, I don’t \n",
      "know if this would help, but I think that indicating that the Fed is on top of the situation and that \n",
      "we are proposing to address economic and credit risks aggressively would help.  In any case, it \n",
      "would at least make clear that the Fed was in touch with the situation. \n",
      "I think we have to take a meaningful action—s omething that will have an important \n",
      "effect.  Therefore, I am proposing a cut of 75 basis points.  I recognize that this is a very large \n",
      "change.  I would not do that if I thought that the size of the cut was inconsistent with our \n",
      "medium-term macroeconomic objectives.  Let me discuss that a few minutes. \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "7 of 32As I said to some of you, on Friday I had a briefing from Dave Stockton and his team \n",
      "about their Greenbook forecast for next week’s meeting.  They have not made an explicit \n",
      "recession call, but they do forecast very weak growth going forward.  More important, in order to \n",
      "get that positive economic growth, they revised down their assumed path of the federal funds rate \n",
      "by 100 basis points—50 basis points next week and 50 basis points in March.  That gives a \n",
      "cumulative decline in the staff’s fed funds assumption of 200 basis points since August, which is \n",
      "consistent both with the markets and with a 225 basis point decline in medium-term r*, which is \n",

      "our conference call a couple of weeks ago, I think our reaction to the incoming data and to the \n",
      "change in financial conditions, even as of a couple of weeks ago, was much smaller than it \n",
      "needed to be to stabilize the economy.  We had a long way to go, and the situation has \n",
      "deteriorated since then, a little bit on the data side—the consumption data were a little  weaker \n",
      "than we expected—but much more in the financial markets.  We have a vicious cycle in housing \n",
      "between the financial markets and the housing markets, where the decline in the housing markets \n",
      "is feeding into the credit markets, which is feeding back on the housing market.  I think there is \n",
      "evidence, as others have cited, that it is spreading geographically a bit to other countries, which \n",
      "means that the export support that we were counting on may not be as strong as it was, and \n",
      "spreading to other markets like the consumer credit markets.  I agree that the equity markets per \n",
      "se aren’t our goal, but declines in equity prices destroy wealth.  I think they are symptomatic, as \n",
      "you indicated, Mr. Chairman, of a fear and a declining confidence in where this economy is \n",
      "going.  That dynamic of declining confidence and growing fear argues for early action despite a \n",
      "number of reasons to wait for the next meeting. \n",
      "I agree with President Poole that no one can be certain what the market reaction will be \n",
      "and what kind of responses we will get now and in the future.  We could look panicky.  We \n",
      "could set up expectations in the future that we would regret.  But I think the greater risk would be \n",
      "in not acting.  Given the dynamic out there, living through another nine days before the next \n",
      "meeting has a very high degree of risk that we could come into that meeting in a very, very \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "21 of 32adverse spot in terms of where the markets are and what is expected of us.  So there is no \n",
      "guarantee of success here.  That is for sure.  But if I were going to place my bets—and I guess I \n",
      "am as a voting member of the Committee— I would place it on acting now rather than later.  \n",
      "President Lockhart talked about the potential positive effects on psychology.  I think that is part \n",
      "of it.  There are also just the normal channels through which monetary policy works on the \n",
      "economy.  Lowering interest rates will help in terms of asset prices, and it will help financing \n",
      "costs; and given the risk of waiting, I think we should get to that right away.  I agree that it is not \n",
      "going to do anything directly for the monolines or for the other institutions that need capital.  But \n",
      "part of what is driving this fear and eroding confidence is the concern about recession.  I think \n",
      "lowering interest rates, doing it promptly, and doing it emphatically with 75 basis points, as well \n",
      "as acting through the usual channels, will help ameliorate that fear. \n",
      "In terms of taking it back, the point that President Hoenig made, I think the history of \n",
      "what we have done is pretty complicated and more complex maybe than that we are always too \n",
      "late taking it back.  If we were always too late, we would have seen an upward trend in inflation.  \n",
      "But we haven’t.  We have seen a downward trend in inflation for the past 25 years.  So it seems \n",
      "to me that the proof of the pudding is in the inflation eating, and I don’t think we have been \n",
      "reluctant to—I mean, yes, you can argue that we should have done it one meeting sooner or that \n",
      "sort of thing.  That is all 20/20 hindsight.  You know, you can always make that argument.  But I \n",
      "think basically monetary policy has accomplished its objectives pretty darn well over this period, \n",
      "reacting to financial market distress and then taking it back when we see the distress being \n",
      "alleviated.  I think, President Hoenig, if we keep our eye on the inflation forecast, if we make \n",
      "sure that we are forward-looking in that regard, that we will take it back in a timely way.  Even if \n",
      "we get started a meeting or two too late, we can move up faster after we start.  So I don’t think \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "22 of 32our history is so unambiguous that we are always late taking things back.  I don’t think the \n",
      "results support that kind of assertion.   \n",
      "I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that we cannot take our eyes off inflation, particularly \n",
      "inflation expectations.  If we had a build in inflation expectations, that would set into motion a \n",
      "very serious and destructive dynamic, especially with the dollar.  But I do think that declining \n",
      "resource utilization, a soft economy, even if it’s not in recession, will exert competitive pressures \n",
      "on both workers and businesses as they consider raising prices.  Our focus right now, as several \n",
      "of you have remarked, given the risk to the economy, must be on financial stability and its \n",
      "implications for the economy.  That is where we need to focus our attention at the moment.  \n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh. \n",
      "MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just make a few brief points.  First, \n",
      "during the discussions on this call, we have described these financial markets as fragile.  That \n",
      "strikes me as rather euphemistic for what we have been witnessing really since the first of this \n",
      "year, particularly what is being witnessed overseas today.  The losses appear to be self-\n",
      "reinforcing.  Panic appears to be begetting further pullbacks by investors, retail and institutional \n",
      "alike.  There seems to be continued interest in the safest currencies, and this pullback strikes me \n",
      "as quite nondiscriminate, geographically and in terms of sectors, companies, and even entire \n",
      "asset classes.  Certainly, we shouldn’t be responding to those moves unless, when we think about \n",
      "our credibility, we think about it both with respect to our inflation-fighting credibility and, I \n",
      "think as Governor Kohn just said, our financial stability credibility.  I think the standard for \n",
      "moving between meetings is a very high one; but looking at the evidence, both in the financial \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "23 of 32markets and in the real economy, and thinking about our own credibility, my sense is that we \n",
      "rather convincingly meet that standard. \n",
      "My judgment would be, if we chose not to act today, that we would in all likelihood not \n",
      "make it until next week.  There can’t be a ton of conviction that by virtue of 75 basis points \n",
      "today we are going to redress some of this fear and some of the psychology that is working \n",
      "against us in the markets.  But just because we don’t have a panacea, just because monetary \n",
      "policy can’t solve the monoline problem and can’t solve some of the other problems, doesn’t \n",
      "mean that we shouldn’t be doing our part.  It strikes me that by taking action today we are doing \n",
      "our part.  We are showing the financial markets and the real businesses that we do get it.  \n",
      "Speaking for myself, I am glad that the interbank funding markets are working better.  That puts \n",
      "them in a better position to take more advantage of changes in monetary policy.  Through the \n",
      "TAF and through time they are now lending to each other.  But based on what has happened in \n",
      "the last several days, it doesn’t look as though they are going to be lending to many others.  So \n",
      "our action today needs to be focused very much on that front. \n",
      "With all that said, Mr. Chairman—and recognizing how quickly the decoupling \n",
      "hypothesis seems to have raced away from these markets as quickly as it found its way into their \n",
      "collective wisdom—we look to emerging markets and look to markets here in the United States.  \n",
      "I think our actions today will go some small way to ensure that markets come back to a more \n",
      "realistic assessment, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that somehow we in any way are going to \n",
      "be solving this problem between now and the next time we meet.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.  \n",
      "MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I think it is very clear that the \n",
      "numbers have weakened significantly from where we were before.  In some sense, the pieces are \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "24 of 32starting to fall in the puzzle, and we were uncertain before— we are still uncertain—but there is a \n",
      "lot more evidence of significant downside risks.  So things, unfortunately, have been clarified on \n",
      "that side.  We have also gotten some data that are not particularly welcome on inflation, which \n",
      "suggests that there are still some challenges there, both in headline and in core.  At the last \n",
      "meeting, a lot of us focused a lot on the potential for a regime switch.  We haven’t really talked \n",
      "about that much here, but I think this evidence suggests that there is much higher probability of a \n",
      "fairly rapid shift from a growth state to a recession state.  That is being reflected in the financial \n",
      "market, so it is just a different way of saying similar things that the Chairman, Governor Kohn, \n",
      "and others of you have said. \n",
      "I think Bill would also say that the credit default swap spreads on a number of the \n",
      "financial institutions have been going up, even as some of the liquidity issues have been coming \n",
      "down.  There are very strong concerns about significant losses coming down the line—concerns \n",
      "not only about the monolines but also, as the Chairman said, about losses just because of the \n",
      "problems in the consumer sector—increasing delinquencies in a variety of areas, not just in \n",
      "subprime mortgages.  That is going to put a lot of stress on bank balance sheets.  Even though \n",
      "the banks have been nimble in bringing in a lot of capital, they have also had astonishingly large \n",
      "losses.  If they continue to have these losses going forward, they just will not be able to churn out \n",
      "the funding that is necessary to keep an economy growing certainly at anything that is close to \n",
      "potential, probably nothing that is close to a positive rate of growth. \n",
      "So it seems that it is sensible to buy some insurance and buy it through taking a bold, \n",
      "decisive action now.  The question, of course, is whether we do that now or whether we do that \n",
      "in nine days.  People have talked about the tradeoff that we have between the value of acting \n",
      "now and averting the possibility of very negative outcomes over the next nine days and some \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "25 of 32concern about developing a bad expectations dynamic and problems of people thinking that we \n",
      "are responding to the equity markets in and of themselves, not what the equity markets are \n",
      "signaling about the real economy.  But I think things are different now than they were earlier in \n",
      "the month, when I was not very supportive of moving at that time.  First, we now have more data \n",
      "in a variety of areas, and we have the concerns about the monolines.  We have a more \n",
      "substantive basis on which to move, so it doesn’t look as though we are responding to just one \n",
      "particular thing; the pieces are there together.  Second, there is a much clearer foundation from \n",
      "the Chairman’s testimony and speech, in which he made it very clear that we would be thinking \n",
      "about and seriously contemplating bold action.  So now there is a foundation for this.  This is not \n",
      "just coming out of the blue or coming out of some rumors in the market.  I think that is a very \n",
      "different situation from the one we had before.  Third, I think it is actually beneficial that we \n",
      "have the meeting coming up in nine days.  That gives us an opportunity to refine the message \n",
      "fairly quickly if we feel we need to and to take further actions if we need to.  So I come out, on \n",
      "balance, thinking that the risks are too high not to act now.  I acknowledge some of those \n",
      "downside risks, but I see that there are very strong benefits to acting now. \n",
      "But I do hear some of the concerns that people have raised, and I had some of these \n",
      "concerns also, particularly with respect to inflation.  I might suggest that in the last paragraph in \n",
      "the proposed FOMC statement, which I am fine with, perhaps a way of showing a little more \n",
      "concern about some of the inflation issues is in the second half of that sentence, where you say \n",
      "“but it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully,” to say instead “but it will be \n",
      "necessary to continue to monitor those inflation developments carefully.”  That might buy us a \n",
      "little there because the statement is a fairly large move away from what we have said before.  \n",
      "This phrase is about the only one that we have repeated from before, and I think strengthening \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "26 of 32that phrase may be beneficial.  But I am supportive of the statement as is.  Perhaps it could be \n",
      "improved with a little strengthening there to address some of the concerns, but I am very much \n",
      "supportive of the overall 75 basis point move now.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig, does a language change on \n",
      "inflation help you at all? \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  It is, I guess, helpful, but let me ask this.  A point that was made earlier, \n",
      "when you said that we are moving to where we need to be, in terms of the real rate, taking total \n",
      "inflation, we are moving to real rates that are negative.  I am fairly confident that, while this is a \n",
      "bold move, it is also a precursor to another move a week or nine days from now, which would \n",
      "put us in an even more negative position, when we are projecting the economy to be slowing and \n",
      "when, in fact, total inflation is above—c urrently at least, year over year—4 percent.  I understand \n",
      "the concerns about the markets and people’s uncertainty.  But we are taking these very dramatic \n",
      "actions right now, more perhaps than what we need when you say “where interest rates need to \n",
      "be.”  If we were to go 50 basis points now and 50 basis points at the next meeting, we are still \n",
      "moving down, but we are taking it in a more measured form.  I am not convinced that isn’t a \n",
      "better way of going, given where we are with the economy and given where we are with our \n",
      "projections looking forward.  That is really something that maybe you could at least address—\n",
      "the negative levels of the real rate in terms of your comfort going forward and where we need to \n",
      "be. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Thank you.  Let me make a few comments.  \n",
      "Thank everyone for your input and your concerns, which I appreciate.  This is a very, very \n",
      "difficult situation, and no one can know exactly how this is going to work out.  But let me try to \n",
      "respond to a few points that were made.  First of all, as I indicated earlier, I would not be \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "27 of 32proposing this if I didn’t think that we were seriously behind the curve in terms of economic \n",
      "growth and the financial situation.  I said that on January 9, and since then the markets and the \n",
      "data have only gotten significantly worse.  I do believe that we are at least 100 basis points \n",
      "behind the curve in terms of neutrality, and so I am quite comfortable with this order of \n",
      "magnitude of move.  Frankly, I think the evidence is very much in favor of it.   \n",
      "With respect to what the real rate is, I would combine my response to you with a \n",
      "comment to President Fisher, which is that real rates depend on expected inflation, not past \n",
      "inflation.  Inflation is a lagging indicator.  We cannot wait until inflation is down before we \n",
      "begin to act.  We have to look at the future.  We have seen oil prices down $10 already.  We just \n",
      "have to make a judgment.  With the economy slowing and with oil prices likely to moderate, the \n",
      "best guess is that inflation will be well controlled going forward.  If that is not the case, we can \n",
      "begin to address it.  But I do believe that, from a forecast viewpoint, we don’t have a negative \n",
      "real interest rate, and we don’t necessarily have inflation above 4 percent. \n",
      "I would like to address the issue of the lesson of 2001.  I don’t think that the problem \n",
      "with 2001 was the rate at which the interest rate was cut.  The interest rate was cut more than \n",
      "500 basis points, including three intermeeting moves of 50 basis points each in 2001.  \n",
      "Nevertheless, at the end of that episode, inflation was too low, which is evidence I think that in \n",
      "some sense the response was even inefficiently slow.  Not that they could have necessarily done \n",
      "better, but clearly it was not the cut itself that led to inflation problems.  Governor Kohn’s points \n",
      "notwithstanding, and it was very difficult to know ex ante what was right, if there is a concern \n",
      "there it has to do with how quickly the rate was raised starting in 2004 going forward, when the \n",
      "economy was already on a growth path.  I think we have learned from that.  I think we will be \n",
      "very sensitive to that.   \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "28 of 32Let me just add that I do intend to be talking more about the outlook and about policy.  I \n",
      "am sure that I will do my best to communicate where I think we are and how we are going to \n",
      "manage policy going forward.  I have talked specifically about the need to be aggressive in the \n",
      "short run, particularly when financial stability is at stake.  So again, my fundamental point is that \n",
      "we are behind the curve.  We need to do something to get up there.   \n",
      "Why does that help markets?  Well, I think there are issues of psychology and dynamics \n",
      "and damage that could be done if we let the markets twist and turn for another nine days.  But the \n",
      "fundamentals are also involved.  The markets essentially—in their incredible efficiency —are \n",
      "bringing into the present concerns about very bad outcomes that might happen in the future.  \n",
      "With fair value accounting, mark to market, and all of those things, the risk that house prices \n",
      "might fall 20 or 30 percent, even the small risk, is affecting today’s credit ratings and credit \n",
      "markdowns.  We can help the markets in a fundamental sense by assuring them that we are \n",
      "aware of these risks and that, though we are not going to necessarily stop a slowdown, we will do \n",
      "our best to minimize the tail risks of a really bad outcome that are right now driving today’s \n",
      "market reactions.  That would help the monoline insurers in the sense that, if the markets become \n",
      "convinced that those risks are much smaller, then the obligations of the monolines insurers will \n",
      "be less, and the willingness to advance capital might be greater. \n",
      "Again, if I thought that we were where we should be and this was just a question of \n",
      "placating the markets, I would not be here talking to you.  But I think that we need to move, and \n",
      "if we move now, we will get a bonus in terms of at least some hope of reducing the fear and the \n",
      "uncertainty that is currently in the markets.  So I do think it matters whether we move today or \n",
      "move nine days from now.  I recognize the risks, but in the two years that I have been here in this \n",
      "position, we have not moved intermeeting.  We waited a long time to move in September after \n",

      "perceived as trigger happy.  I think that we need to be catching up to where the right interest rate \n",
      "is, and that is the essence of the issue.  I guess that is all I have to say.  \n",
      " As I said, Governor Mishkin is not here.  For what it is worth, he authorized me to say \n",
      "that he supports the action and the statement.  We are currently at a very critical juncture.  We \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I hear you, and I appreciate your concerns.  I do \n",
      "understand that there is a psychology in the market that is having its effect.  I think if we make \n",
      "this statement as strong as we can about the need to watch inflation, and if we understand among \n",
      "ourselves that, as we take this action today and the follow-up actions that I am certain we are \n",
      "going to take, we will watch these inflation numbers, including broad asset values—I know we \n",
      "don’t prick bubbles and that sort of thing, but watching these broad asset-price movements—that \n",
      "would be very, very important, at least to think about.  I do not wish to be dissenting on this, as \n",
      "troubled as I am about it.  I do understand the psychology of it.  For those reasons, I am willing \n",
      "to go along with this.  But I worry about our ability to deal with reversal as this takes place, \n",
      "especially given where our projections for growth are right now and my concern that we already \n",
      "have inflation above 4 percent.  So I defer to you at this point.  I would vote for it because I think \n",

    "The global financial crisis (GFC) refers to the period of extreme stress in global financial markets and banking systems between mid 2007 and early 2009. During the GFC, a downturn in the US housing market was a catalyst for a financial crisis that spread from the United States to the rest of the world through linkages in the global financial system. Many banks around the world incurred large losses and relied on government support to avoid bankruptcy. Millions of people lost their jobs as the major advanced economies experienced their deepest recessions since the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for taking time on \n",
      "your holiday.  The purpose of this meeting is to update the Committee on financial developments \n",
      "over the weekend and to consider whether we want to take a policy action today.  I would like to \n",
      "start with a brief update on the markets from Bill Dudley and take any questions for him, and \n",
      "then I will introduce the issue, make a recommendation, and ask for your comments following \n",
      "that.  Bill, would you like to give us a short review? \n",
      " \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our videoconference on \n",
      "January 9, the market functioning in terms of the bank term funding markets has \n",
      "generally continued to improve, with the one-month and three-month LIBOR relative \n",
      "to the overnight index swap rates coming back very sharply.  They are now as narrow \n",
      "as they’ve been since the market turmoil began.  But elsewhere in terms of market \n",
      "functioning, we started to see a step backward last week—e specially late in the \n",
      "week—when we viewed the asset -backed commercial paper market beginning to \n",
      "deteriorate again, and there was some flight to quality into the Treasury bill market \n",
      "late last week. \n",
      " \n",
      " More important, the macro outlook and broader financial market conditions \n",
      "have continued to deteriorate quite sharply.  The S&P 500 index, for example, fell \n",
      "5.4 percent last week; it is down almost 10 percent so far this year.  Today it fell \n",
      "another 60 points, or 4.5 percent, so that means that the cumulative decline in the \n",
      "S&P 500, if it opens near where the futures markets closed today, will be nearly \n",
      "15 percent since the start of the year.  Global stock markets were also down very \n",
      "sharply today—Mo nday.  Depending on where you look, the range of decline was \n",
      "anywhere from 3 percent to 7½ percent, pretty much across the board.  Corporate \n",
      "credit spreads and credit default spreads have continued to widen, and bank mark-to-\n",
      "market losses and loan-loss provisions keep increasing.  The Merrill Lynch and \n",
      "Citigroup earnings announcements last week generally suggested a widening in terms \n",
      "of the scope of losses, not just in subprime but also in terms of credit card receivables \n",
      "and other loans. \n",
      " \n",
      "  A newish wrinkle here in terms of bank markdowns reflects the deterioration of \n",
      "some of the monoline guarantors.  Merrill Lynch, for example, announced a \n",
      "multibillion dollar charge for its exposure to ACA, which is the most impaired of the \n",
      "monoline guarantors.  The other monoline guarantors are in better shape, but they’ve \n",
      "either been downgraded, such as the case of Ambac by Fitch on Friday afternoon, or \n",
      "are under review for being downgraded by a number of different credit-rating \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "3 of 32agencies.  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising capital has \n",
      "become much more difficult.  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent \n",
      "surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar.  It’s not clear \n",
      "how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating.  The goal posts keep \n",
      "moving.  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates on subprime mortgages about a \n",
      "week and a half ago, and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms of \n",
      "their capital adequacy.   \n",
      " \n",
      "So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional \n",
      "capital soon, further rating downgrades seem very, very likely.  This has three \n",
      "potential consequences that are noteworthy.  First, in the money market space, a \n",
      "number of money market products are wrapped by the monoline guarantors, including \n",
      "variable-rate demand notes, auction-rate securities, and tender option bonds.  Some of \n",
      "these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over, they’ll \n",
      "go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets.  For those \n",
      "without liquidity support, either they will be converted to longer-dated securities, \n",
      "which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or the dealers will \n",
      "have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing.  A second \n",
      "consequence from monoline guarantor downgrades would be to the municipal bond \n",
      "funds.  The loss of AAA insurance raises the question of what the retail bond \n",
      "investors do.  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty \n",
      "calm on that front.  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major \n",
      "muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week.  So there are no \n",
      "signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully, given the fact that \n",
      "only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late \n",
      "last week.  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the value of the \n",
      "guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen.  In contrast, the monolines \n",
      "don’t have to mark to market.  Downgrading the monolines frontloads the hit to \n",
      "capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because market \n",
      "valuations can overshoot.  So it is not trivial to transfer this risk from the monolines \n",
      "to the financial institutions given the distinction that the monolines do not have to \n",
      "mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do. \n",
      " \n",
      "At this point, monetary policy expectations have priced in a lot of easing over the \n",
      "near term.  As of Friday’s close, there were about 67 basis points priced in through \n",
      "the January meeting at the end of the month and about 110 basis points priced in \n",
      "through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract).  \n",
      "There is likely more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that \n",
      "we saw today.  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed.  I’ll be happy to \n",
      "take any questions, of course. \n",
      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker? \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I \n",
      "didn’t quite get that. \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "4 of 32MR. DUDLEY.  The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences \n",
      "of the deterioration in, say, the structured-finance product they insured.  All they have to do is \n",
      "pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured-finance product can’t pay out.  So their \n",
      "losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time.  There is no sort of \n",
      "foreshortening of all that into the present.  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded \n",
      "and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to \n",
      "write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee.  So it’s \n",
      "quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline \n",
      "guarantors to the financial institutions that bought that insurance. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  President Hoenig. \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be \n",
      "saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would \n",
      "appreciate just his sense of things. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere \n",
      "around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up \n",
      "to now had performed pretty well.  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a \n",
      "very long time.  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger \n",
      "than the declines that we saw in Asia.  For example, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index, which is \n",
      "an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday.  The market went \n",
      "down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it came sharply down \n",
      "again at the close.  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day.  \n",
      "Bond markets reacted as you might expect.  Bond markets rallied as people became more \n",
      "pessimistic about the stock market.  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk-\n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "5 of 32aversion behavior.  The euro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen \n",
      "appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites.   \n",
      "I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe.  I didn’t really feel as though \n",
      "my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantors.  That was part of the \n",
      "story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t \n",
      "going to happen to the degree that we hoped.  Also, part of the story was that the risks of \n",
      "recession in the United States were increasing.  So financial guarantors got part of the blame for \n",
      "the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue \n",
      "here.  I was reluctant to call this meeting, both because of the holiday and because the \n",
      "Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled \n",
      "meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9.  However, I think there are times when \n",
      "events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting.  I know it is only a week \n",
      "away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets.  As Bill described, over the \n",
      "holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe.  As he \n",
      "mentioned, even though the U.S. markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today, \n",
      "close to 5 percent.  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC \n",
      "meeting 16½ percent.  Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock \n",
      "investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the \n",
      "economy and increasing problems in credit markets. \n",
      "On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets \n",
      "reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession.  \n",
      "Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "6 of 32have global consequences.  Consequently, we saw, for example, an 8 percent drop today in the \n",
      "German stock market.  The dollar rose today, reflecting I think increasing belief that other \n",
      "central banks will have to follow us in cutting rates, and oil prices are down to about $87, \n",
      "reflecting expectations of slowing global demand.  So it is not necessarily a U.S.-only story. \n",
      "On the financial side, as Bill noted, a lot of things are going on.  The latest is the likely \n",
      "downgrade of one or more of the monoline insurers, which would cause banks and other \n",
      "financial institutions to have to mark down billions more of their holdings.  I think there is a \n",
      "general sense— I certainly feel in talking to market participants—that it is not just subprime \n",
      "anymore and that there are real concerns about other kinds of consumer credit—c redit cards, \n",
      "autos, and home equity loans—and that there is fear of housing prices falling enough that \n",
      "contagion will infect prime mortgage loans.  There is building in the market a real dynamic of \n",
      "withdrawal from risk, withdrawal from normal credit extension, which I think is very worrisome. \n",
      "Would a rate action today, before the start of trading tomorrow, be of help?  I don’t \n",
      "know.  In some sense it was a lucky break that today was a holiday because in the middle of the \n",
      "day we got a very good read on what the markets are doing tomorrow, and so we can get ahead \n",
      "of things as opposed to being forced, after a couple of disastrous days, to respond.  Again, I don’t \n",
      "know if this would help, but I think that indicating that the Fed is on top of the situation and that \n",
      "we are proposing to address economic and credit risks aggressively would help.  In any case, it \n",
      "would at least make clear that the Fed was in touch with the situation. \n",
      "I think we have to take a meaningful action—s omething that will have an important \n",
      "effect.  Therefore, I am proposing a cut of 75 basis points.  I recognize that this is a very large \n",
      "change.  I would not do that if I thought that the size of the cut was inconsistent with our \n",
      "medium-term macroeconomic objectives.  Let me discuss that a few minutes. \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "7 of 32As I said to some of you, on Friday I had a briefing from Dave Stockton and his team \n",
      "about their Greenbook forecast for next week’s meeting.  They have not made an explicit \n",
      "recession call, but they do forecast very weak growth going forward.  More important, in order to \n",
      "get that positive economic growth, they revised down their assumed path of the federal funds rate \n",
      "by 100 basis points—50 basis points next week and 50 basis points in March.  That gives a \n",
      "cumulative decline in the staff’s fed funds assumption of 200 basis points since August, which is \n",
      "consistent both with the markets and with a 225 basis point decline in medium-term r*, which is \n",
      "an indicator of the neutral rate, as well as the optimal policy rate that they calculate.  Importantly, \n",
      "of course, we have lowered the funds rate only 100 basis points so far, so I think at first \n",
      "approximation we are about 100 basis points behind the curve—something in that general area —\n",
      "in terms of the neutral rate, and that itself doesn’t even take into account what I believe at this \n",
      "point is a legitimate need for risk management.   \n",
      "With respect to risk management, these credit risks obviously have the potential to feed \n",
      "back into our financial system and to affect the economy going forward.  I hope to be able to talk \n",
      "next week more about a simulation the staff is working on, which shows that a severe recession \n",
      "would create extraordinary credit losses for our financial institutions, with implications \n",
      "obviously for credit extension and for financial stability.  It is just one indicator, but a paper by \n",
      "Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff has been circulated in the past couple of days, which compares \n",
      "some indicators of our economy with other major financial crises and finds that we rank at the \n",
      "moment among the five largest financial crises in any industrial country since World War II.  \n",
      "Given what their indicators show, they conclude that, if we have only a mild recession in the \n",
      "United States, it would be a very fortunate outcome.  Now, I am not saying that this is \n",
      "necessarily evidence, but I am saying that there are risks and that a careful approach should \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "8 of 32allow for some easing with respect to risks.  Governor Mishkin is not here.  He is aware of this \n",
      "meeting, but he is on the slopes— I think in Idaho somewhere.  He has made I think a case for \n",
      "being more aggressive initially, trying to address the problem, and then removing \n",
      "accommodation as the situation calms down.  I think there is a case for doing that, given the fact \n",
      "that we have done 100 basis points and that we seem to have not really made a dent. \n",
      "Now, of course, there is also the issue of inflation.  Many of you have valid concerns \n",
      "about inflation.  Let me just make a few comments on that.  First, in the Greenbook, despite a \n",
      "100 basis point drop in the rate assumption and the scenario that I take as being in some sense \n",
      "optimistic in that it avoids an outright recession, the preliminary Greenbook forecast for 2009 \n",
      "has total PCE inflation at 1.7 percent and core PCE inflation at 1.9 percent.  This does not take \n",
      "into account any disinflationary effects that would arise if we did have an NBER recession or \n",
      "worse.  Again, I note that we have, for example, effects working through oil prices, which the \n",
      "Greenbook doesn’t take into account directly.  So I think, obviously, that we have to continue to \n",
      "watch inflation and inflation expectations carefully.  It is very important to do so.  But at this \n",
      "point we are facing, potentially, a broad-based crisis.  We can no longer temporize.  We have to \n",

      "risks of the financial markets.  All those are relevant to what we do next week.  But the key issue \n",
      "for me is what we get by acting now rather than nine days from now.  I note that the stock market \n",
      "has declined, despite the fact that the market has built in the expectation of 50 basis points, with \n",
      "some probability of 75.  If we do today pretty much exactly what is expected of us nine days \n",

      "response to the stock market.  I understand the comments about the other strains in the financial \n",
      "markets.  Although the thing that we have most commonly pointed to, and it has occasioned the \n",
      "most market discussion, has to do with the behavior of the LIBOR rate, LIBOR seems to have \n",

      "It is a matter of judgment, and I think your judgment on this is right.  I strongly support it.  I just \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I am troubled by this, I will admit.  I understand the \n",

      "well, and the need for the TAF may be diminishing.  Not much more data will come in the next \n",

      "were to cut rates to this level today, as of now, in terms of the headline CPI and PCE numbers, \n",
      "we would have a negative real rate of interest, and I don’t understand quite fully what the \n",

      "than we expected—but much more in the financial markets.  We have a vicious cycle in housing \n",
      "between the financial markets and the housing markets, where the decline in the housing markets \n",
      "is feeding into the credit markets, which is feeding back on the housing market.  I think there is \n",

      "means that the export support that we were counting on may not be as strong as it was, and \n",
      "spreading to other markets like the consumer credit markets.  I agree that the equity markets per \n",
      "se aren’t our goal, but declines in equity prices destroy wealth.  I think they are symptomatic, as \n",
      "you indicated, Mr. Chairman, of a fear and a declining confidence in where this economy is \n",

      "in not acting.  Given the dynamic out there, living through another nine days before the next \n",

      "President Lockhart talked about the potential positive effects on psychology.  I think that is part \n",
      "of it.  There are also just the normal channels through which monetary policy works on the \n",
      "economy.  Lowering interest rates will help in terms of asset prices, and it will help financing \n",
      "costs; and given the risk of waiting, I think we should get to that right away.  I agree that it is not \n",
      "going to do anything directly for the monolines or for the other institutions that need capital.  But \n",

      "late taking it back.  If we were always too late, we would have seen an upward trend in inflation.  \n",

      "during the discussions on this call, we have described these financial markets as fragile.  That \n",
      "strikes me as rather euphemistic for what we have been witnessing really since the first of this \n",
      "year, particularly what is being witnessed overseas today.  The losses appear to be self-\n",
      "reinforcing.  Panic appears to be begetting further pullbacks by investors, retail and institutional \n",
      "alike.  There seems to be continued interest in the safest currencies, and this pullback strikes me \n",
      "as quite nondiscriminate, geographically and in terms of sectors, companies, and even entire \n",
      "asset classes.  Certainly, we shouldn’t be responding to those moves unless, when we think about \n",
      "our credibility, we think about it both with respect to our inflation-fighting credibility and, I \n",
      "think as Governor Kohn just said, our financial stability credibility.  I think the standard for \n",
      "moving between meetings is a very high one; but looking at the evidence, both in the financial \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "23 of 32markets and in the real economy, and thinking about our own credibility, my sense is that we \n",
      "rather convincingly meet that standard. \n",
      "My judgment would be, if we chose not to act today, that we would in all likelihood not \n",
      "make it until next week.  There can’t be a ton of conviction that by virtue of 75 basis points \n",
      "today we are going to redress some of this fear and some of the psychology that is working \n",
      "against us in the markets.  But just because we don’t have a panacea, just because monetary \n",
      "policy can’t solve the monoline problem and can’t solve some of the other problems, doesn’t \n",
      "mean that we shouldn’t be doing our part.  It strikes me that by taking action today we are doing \n",
      "our part.  We are showing the financial markets and the real businesses that we do get it.  \n",
      "Speaking for myself, I am glad that the interbank funding markets are working better.  That puts \n",
      "them in a better position to take more advantage of changes in monetary policy.  Through the \n",
      "TAF and through time they are now lending to each other.  But based on what has happened in \n",
      "the last several days, it doesn’t look as though they are going to be lending to many others.  So \n",
      "our action today needs to be focused very much on that front. \n",
      "With all that said, Mr. Chairman—and recognizing how quickly the decoupling \n",

      "about that much here, but I think this evidence suggests that there is much higher probability of a \n",
      "fairly rapid shift from a growth state to a recession state.  That is being reflected in the financial \n",

      "financial institutions have been going up, even as some of the liquidity issues have been coming \n",
      "down.  There are very strong concerns about significant losses coming down the line—concerns \n",
      "not only about the monolines but also, as the Chairman said, about losses just because of the \n",
      "problems in the consumer sector—increasing delinquencies in a variety of areas, not just in \n",

      "just coming out of the blue or coming out of some rumors in the market.  I think that is a very \n",

      "put us in an even more negative position, when we are projecting the economy to be slowing and \n",
      "when, in fact, total inflation is above—c urrently at least, year over year—4 percent.  I understand \n",
      "the concerns about the markets and people’s uncertainty.  But we are taking these very dramatic \n",
      "actions right now, more perhaps than what we need when you say “where interest rates need to \n",
      "be.”  If we were to go 50 basis points now and 50 basis points at the next meeting, we are still \n",
      "moving down, but we are taking it in a more measured form.  I am not convinced that isn’t a \n",
      "better way of going, given where we are with the economy and given where we are with our \n",

      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good evening, everybody.  I am sorry, once again, to have \n",
      "to call you together on short notice.  We live in a very special time.  We have seen, as you know, \n",
      "significant deterioration in term funding markets and more broadly in the financial markets in the \n",
      "last few days.  Some of this is credit deterioration, certainly, given increased expectations of \n",
      "recession; but there also seem to be some self-feeding liquidity dynamics at work as well.  So the \n",
      "question before us is whether there are actions we can take, other than monetary policy, to break \n",
      "or mitigate this adverse dynamic. \n",
      "There are two actions on the table, which I think we should just try to consider together, \n",
      "if possible.  The first is the proposed term securities lending facility—I know you received the \n",
      "documentation on this without much notice, but we will get some explanation in the meeting.  \n",
      "The second item—we have received formal requests from the European Central Bank (ECB) and \n",
      "from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to expand and extend the currency swap lines that we have \n",
      "with them.  As you recall, in December we had a coordinated action, which involved the ECB \n",
      "and the SNB doing dollar funding auctions that piggybacked on our term auction facility.  They \n",
      "stopped doing that after the turn of the year, but they would like to return to doing that now for \n",
      "some time.  They think that dollar funding conditions warrant it.  They are requesting that we \n",
      "raise their swap lines.  The ECB’s line is currently $20 billion.  It would like to raise its line to \n",
      "$30 billion, so it can do two $15 billion auctions a month.  The Swiss National Bank would like \n",
      "to have its $4 billion line raised to $6 billion, so it can do one $6 billion auction each month.  \n",
      "That would be a coordinated effort.  We would have a joint statement, along with the United \n",
      "Kingdom and Canada, and also supporting statements from Sweden and Japan.  So it would be a \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "3 of 39type of coordination similar to the one we saw in December.  Again, the request is to increase the \n",
      "swap lines and to extend them, and we propose to extend them through September 30.  That \n",
      "requires a vote of the FOMC, and so, again, we have two items for your discussion. \n",
      "I would like to proceed as follows.  I am going to turn first to Bill Dudley and his \n",
      "colleagues in New York to give us a brief update on market conditions and then to outline for us \n",
      "the proposed term securities lending facility and how it would work and what we hope it would \n",
      "do in the markets.  I don’t think extensive exposition of the swaps is necessary, but any questions \n",
      "are welcome.  After New York’s presentation, we have Bill, Brian Madigan, Scott Alvarez, and \n",
      "other staff here, if you have any questions.  Following that, we would have a go-round and get \n",
      "comments and positions, and then we proceed to votes.  So without further ado, let me turn to \n",
      "Bill in New York to start with a market update and then to talk a bit about the proposed facility.  \n",
      "Bill. \n",
      " \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financial conditions have worsened \n",
      "considerably in recent days.  Credit spreads have widened, equity prices have \n",
      "declined, and market functioning has deteriorated sharply.  Although there are many \n",
      "factors that can be cited to explain what we are seeing—including the acute weakness \n",
      "in the U.S. housing sector, a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, and the loss of \n",
      "faith in credit ratings and structured-finance products—we may have entered a new , \n",
      "dangerous phase of the crisis.  Major financial intermediaries are pulling back more \n",
      "sharply and along more margins than previously—shrinking their collateral lending \n",
      "books and raising the haircuts they assess against repo collateral.  For a time, this \n",
      "adjustment was occurring in a relatively orderly way, but we appear to have passed \n",
      "that point about ten days ago.  The failure of Peloton—a major hedge fund —and the \n",
      "well-publicized problems of Thornburg Mortgage and Carlyle Capital Corporation in \n",
      "meeting margin calls have triggered a dangerous dynamic.   \n",
      " \n",
      "That dynamic goes something like this:  Asset price declines—say , triggered by \n",
      "deterioration in the outlook—lead to margin calls.  Some highly leveraged firms are \n",
      "unable to meet these calls.  Dealers respond by liquidating collateral.  This puts \n",
      "downward pressure on asset prices and increases price volatility.  Dealers raise \n",
      "haircuts further to compensate for the heightened volatility and the reduced liquidity \n",
      "in the market.  This, in turn, puts more pressure on other leveraged investors.  A \n",
      "vicious circle ensues of higher haircuts, fire sales, lower prices, higher volatility, and \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "4 of 39still lower prices, and financial intermediaries start to break as a liquidity crisis \n",
      "potentially leads to insolvency when assets are sold at fire sale prices. \n",
      " \n",
      "This dynamic poses significant risks.  First, it impairs the monetary policy \n",
      "transmission mechanism.  We have seen that in recent weeks in the sharp widening \n",
      "between mortgage rates on an option-adjusted basis and Treasury bond rates.  Second, \n",
      "as hinted at above, there is a systemic issue.  If the vicious circle were to continue \n",
      "unabated, the liquidity issues could become solvency issues, and major financial \n",
      "intermediaries could conceivably fail.  I don’t want to be alarmist, but even today we \n",
      "saw double-digit stock price declines for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  There were \n",
      "rumors today that Bear Stearns was having funding difficulties:  At one point today, \n",
      "its stock was down 14 percent before recovering a bit.  Third, the problems in one \n",
      "financial market disturb others.  We have seen the problems move from subprime to \n",
      "alt-A mortgages to jumbo prime mortgages and now even agency mortgage-backed \n",
      "securities.  Commercial-mortgage-backed security spreads and corporate credit \n",
      "spreads have also widened, and we have seen considerable distortions in the \n",
      "municipal market. \n",
      " \n",
      "The deterioration in market function can be seen in a number of ways.  First, term \n",
      "funding spreads have widened back out.  For example, the one-month LIBOR–OIS \n",
      "spread today is 56 basis points, up from its low point in 2008 of 16 basis points, \n",
      "which was reached in January.  Second, haircuts for residential MBS have increased \n",
      "sharply, and if anything, the rate of deterioration in terms of haircuts has accelerated \n",
      "markedly in the last week.  Third, bid-asked spreads for transactions on many types of \n",
      "financial instruments have widened, indicating a growing liquidity problem in the \n",
      "market. \n",
      " \n",
      "To address these issues, the Federal Reserve has responded by increasing the size \n",
      "of the TAF program and by implementing a large, term, single-tranche RP program.  \n",
      "Together, these two programs will likely cumulate to total outstandings of about \n",
      "$200 billion.  In addition, as the Chairman mentioned, the ECB and the SNB today \n",
      "have submitted requests to increase their foreign exchange swap draws and restart \n",
      "their term funding auctions.  But there are limits to what these programs can do.  The \n",
      "TAF provides liquidity only to depository institutions—this liquidity is not \n",
      "necessarily passed on readily to primary dealers and to other financial institutions.  \n",
      "Although term RPs do provide some assistance to primary dealers, these operations \n",
      "are limited to the highest quality collateral—Treasuries, agencies, and agency \n",
      "mortgage-backed securities.  Moreover, as both programs are scaled up, there is a \n",
      "large impact on reserves that must be offset by Treasury redemptions, sales, or \n",
      "reverse repurchase operations.  Frankly, there are limits to our ability to adjust our \n",
      "portfolio quickly without our actions becoming a source of disruption to financial \n",
      "markets.   \n",
      " \n",
      "For this reason, the staff has proposed a new facility, the term securities lending \n",
      "facility, or TSLF.  A memo from the New York Fed staff and a term sheet were \n",
      "circulated to the FOMC earlier today, and these documents discuss in some detail this \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "5 of 39proposal.  Let me give a summary of what I see as the most important points.  In \n",
      "brief, this facility would expand the Federal Reserve’s securities lending program for \n",
      "primary dealers by lending securities secured for a term of 28 days, rather than \n",
      "overnight, by a pledge of other securities—Treasuries, agencies, agency mortgage-\n",
      "backed securities, or AAA-rated private-label mortgage-backed securities.  The last \n",
      "category is not currently eligible for open market operations (OMO).  Currently, our \n",
      "securities lending program is overnight and exchanges only Treasuries for Treasuries.  \n",
      "The purpose of this facility is to help alleviate the rapidly escalating pressures evident \n",
      "in term collateral funding markets.  \n",
      " \n",
      "So how would this facility help to accomplish this?  By providing the ability to \n",
      "swap illiquid mortgage-backed collateral for Treasury securities, the program would \n",
      "reduce the uncertainty among dealers about their ability to finance such collateral.  \n",
      "The expanded supply of Treasuries obtained in the collateral swaps would improve \n",
      "the ability of primary dealers to finance the positions on their balance sheets.  This \n",
      "should, in turn, increase the willingness of dealers to make markets across a range of \n",
      "securities.  Better market-making, in turn, should lead to greater liquidity for these \n",
      "securities.  This, then, should reduce price volatility and obviate the need for dealers \n",
      "to assess higher haircuts against such securities.  The liquidity option provided by the \n",
      "TSLF should reduce liquidity risk more generally.  The program should help slow, or \n",
      "even reverse, the dynamic process of reduced liquidity, greater price volatility, higher \n",
      "haircuts, margin calls, and forced liquidation.   \n",
      " \n",
      "Why does the staff recommend that the scope of collateral be broader than OMO-\n",
      "eligible collateral?  The staff believes that a program based only on OMO collateral \n",
      "could help improve liquidity in those markets.  An improvement in liquidity in these \n",
      "core markets could help other related markets.  Despite this, the staff recommends \n",
      "that the TSLF go one step further and also accept AAA-rated private-label residential-\n",
      "mortgage-backed securities in this program.  The staff believes that it is important to \n",
      "take this additional step because the level of dysfunction in the non-agency mortgage-\n",
      "backed securities market is pronounced, this market is large, and steps to improve \n",
      "market function in this asset class are likely to have positive consequences for the \n",
      "availability and the cost of mortgage finance.  In other words, improvement in this \n",
      "area would make monetary policy more effective and would likely generate \n",
      "significant macroeconomic benefits. \n",
      " \n",
      "To limit the credit risk exposure of the Federal Reserve, the facility for non-\n",
      "OMO-eligible collateral would be limited to AAA-rated residential-mortgage-backed \n",
      "securities assets not on review for downgrade.  In addition, the securities would be \n",
      "repriced daily, and appropriate haircuts would be applied against such securities.  \n",
      "Why not go further?  Although the SOMA lending facility could be extended to \n",
      "include other asset classes such as commercial-mortgage-backed securities, \n",
      "corporates, and municipals, the staff recommends against such a broader extension \n",
      "for two reasons.  First, these markets are not under the same degree of duress as the \n",
      "residential-mortgage-backed securities market.  Second, adding additional asset \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "6 of 39classes would increase the operational complexity and risk of the program—for \n",
      "example, by requiring additional auction cycles. \n",
      " \n",
      "What are the risks of such a program?  We think there are several risks that are \n",
      "particularly noteworthy.  First, we cannot be sure that the program will have its \n",
      "intended impact.  Experience with the TAF suggests that it will, but there is no \n",
      "guarantee of this.  Second, the TSLF could increase moral hazard.  If the program is \n",
      "successful in preventing losses that would have arisen from an inability to obtain \n",
      "funding, the TSLF would be a form of insurance that could conceivably induce \n",
      "broker–dealers to run smaller liquidity cushions during normal times.  Third, Federal \n",
      "Reserve credit risk would increase as the SOMA portfolio accepted lower-quality \n",
      "collateral from primary dealers.   \n",
      " \n",
      "On the first point—W ill it work?—the TSLF would be quite large, perhaps \n",
      "cumulating to $200 billion, the same size as the TAF and the term RP program \n",
      "combined.  We can make it even bigger if we desire.  So we think we have the muscle \n",
      "here to have an impact on term funding markets.  On the second point—the moral \n",
      "hazard issue—the staff believes that the TSLF will increase moral hazard somewhat.  \n",
      "Ideally, this type of program would also be accompanied by prudential regulation to \n",
      "ensure that primary dealers hold adequate liquidity buffers across the typical business \n",
      "cycle.  On the third point—the issue of credit risk to the Federal Reserve— we \n",
      "conclude that there will inevitably be some increase in credit risk.  But this risk \n",
      "should be controllable.  We know our counterparties, we are not accepting securities \n",
      "that are on watch for downgrades, and the non-agency MBS securities will be AAA-\n",
      "rated.  Moreover, we plan to limit the exposure to the more robust AAA-rated MBS \n",
      "by not accepting private-label MBS with CDO-type structures and characteristics.  \n",
      "And if securities are put on watch, we can demand substitution.   \n",
      " \n",
      "Fully cognizant of these risks and others—which are outlined in more detail in the \n",
      "memorandum circulated to the FOMC earlier today— we conclude that the benefits \n",
      "are likely to significantly exceed the costs of the program.  The staff believes it is \n",
      "important to take those steps necessary to restore the monetary policy transmission \n",
      "mechanism to working order and to short-circuit the vicious dynamic now evident in \n",
      "financial markets.  Debby Perelmuter will now describe the TSLF program in more \n",
      "detail, focusing on how it will operate in practice, now that I’ve outlined the theory.  \n",
      "Debby.  \n",
      " \n",
      " MS. PERELMUTER.  Thanks, Bill.  Should the Committee approve the proposal \n",
      "for the TSLF, we intend to announce tomorrow to the public the total program size \n",
      "envisioned as of today—as Bill mentioned, up to $200 billion.  It will consist of \n",
      "$100 billion against pledges of OMO-eligible collateral and $100 billion against \n",
      "pledges of TSLF-eligible collateral beyond the OMO-eligible.  Together the two \n",
      "tranches will be comparable in size to the TAF program plus the recently announced \n",
      "28-day single tranche RPs. \n",
      " \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "7 of 39For an immediate impact, we are thinking about auctioning $50 billion in each of \n",
      "the tranches at the outset, with the first auction occurring during the week of March \n",
      "24.  Specifically, the plan is to hold separate 28-day auctions for each main category \n",
      "of collateral in successive weeks with our primary dealer counterparties.  We will \n",
      "auction the first tranche against pledges of OMO-eligible collateral on Thursday, \n",
      "March 27, to settle the following day (T+1) and to mature 28 days hence, and we will \n",
      "auction the second tranche against pledges of the non-OMO-eligible collateral on the \n",
      "following Thursday, April 3, also for T+1 and for a period of 28 days.  The auctions \n",
      "will be held at 2:00 p.m. and will close at 2:30 p.m. with results posted shortly \n",
      "thereafter.  We plan to auction in this pattern, each Thursday, alternating between the \n",
      "two collateral tranches for the duration of the facility.   \n",
      " \n",
      "The auctions will be based on a fee rate, in a bonds-versus-bonds construct.  It is \n",
      "similar to our daily securities lending operations, and it is very familiar to our primary \n",
      "dealers.  The fee rate bid will represent the spread, in basis points, between the cost of \n",
      "28-day financing of general collateral Treasury securities and the cost of 28-day \n",
      "financing of the respective basket of collateral in the respective tranche.  As with the \n",
      "TAF auctions and our daily securities lending operations, a minimum fee will be set \n",
      "by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the collateral tranches ahead of \n",
      "each auction.  The fee will be set by a competitive single-priced auction process in \n",
      "which the accepted dealer bids will be awarded at the same fee rate, which shall be \n",
      "the lowest fee rate at which bids were accepted.  Similar to our temporary open \n",
      "market operations, haircuts for the OMO-eligible collateral pledged will be the same, \n",
      "given that the facility is open to the same set of counterparties—the pr imary \n",
      "dealers—and the collateral in this tranche is identical.  In addition, the Federal \n",
      "Reserve Bank of New York will use the services of the major clearing banks, BONY \n",
      "and JPMorgan Chase, and all transfers of collateral will be made through the \n",
      "borrower’s clearing bank account.  This is how we do things for our open market \n",
      "operations. \n",
      " \n",
      "Overall, the terms and conditions are similar to those of the TAF auctions in the \n",
      "following ways.  There will be a 28-day fixed fee determined via a single-price \n",
      "centralized auction.  The TSLF will have a minimum fee rate, and settlement will be \n",
      "forward settling.  The term of operation will be 28 days except for holiday conflicts.  \n",
      "The TSLF will have a minimum bid amount ($10 million as opposed to $5 million in \n",
      "the TAF).  The maximum number of bids per participant will be two.  The total \n",
      "propositions for each bid submitted and the total award may not exceed a specified \n",
      "percentage of the announced offering amount.  We are contemplating a 20 percent \n",
      "limit per dealer.  If a participant ceases to qualify for the TSLF (if it is no longer a \n",
      "primary dealer, for instance), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may accelerate \n",
      "the unwinding of the loan, making the return of any pledged collateral immediately \n",
      "due. \n",

      "10 of 39the stick part of this.  I can understand the carrot side of this thing, and we are doing it for the \n",

      "get in return, and how do we make sure that, since we are not the regulator of these dealers, there \n",
      "is indeed discipline?  I would like to know what your answer is.  Do we have an arrangement \n",
      "with the SEC, or how do we work with the other regulators to make sure that discipline is \n",

      "lesser-quality paper in return for high-quality paper over the defined time frame that you stated \n",
      "and under the conditions that you stated.  But I am just a little worried about being taken \n",
      "advantage of here.  So the question is specifically about the “prudential regulation” of those \n",
      "people that we’re dealing with.  Then, I have other questions to follow. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the first thing I would say, President Fisher, is that we are doing \n",
      "this collateral swap for a fee and for one that is higher than the normal fee in normal markets.  So \n",
      "in no way is it free.  In terms of the prudential regulation, I think there will be a lot of lessons \n",

      "we are going to have to remember when we look at what we have learned from this experience. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would like to note that I did talk to Chairman Cox today \n",
      "about this and got his strong support. \n",
      "MR. FISHER.  Again, I think it would be helpful, Mr. Chairman—you and I talked about \n",

      "input.  Just to move on, on the question of the haircut, as I understand it from the paper, on the \n",
      "non-OMO eligible collateral, we are talking about an 8 percent haircut—is that correct?  \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  That is the working assumption for the time being.  We are going to \n",
      "have conversations with our primary dealers, and that is where we are going to really fine-tune \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "11 of 39what the appropriate haircut is.  But I think the general operating principle here is to have \n",

      "market during times of crisis, which we would argue that we are in or are close to being in right \n",

      "touch with reality, which we now know.  Obviously, you are going to be prudent about this, but \n",

      "MR. DUDLEY.  For AAA collateral, I think it is actually lower than that.  I think it is \n",
      "3 percent, so we would expect that the haircut should be higher because we are dealing with \n",
      "primary dealers rather than depository institutions as our counterparties.  So we certainly accept \n",
      "the fact that there should be higher haircuts. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart. \n",
      "MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The question relates to what President \n",
      "Fisher was pursuing, which, if I understand correctly, is our chance of actually incurring a loss in \n",
      "holding the less creditworthy paper.  That would relate to a default on the part of a broker–dealer \n",
      "in unwinding the swap and then an ultimate loss in how we dispose of the paper over time if we \n",
      "were to hold it.  So the question is, Are we aware of any primary dealers who are really in \n",
      "serious condition at this stage and constitute a “first way out” risk? \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "12 of 39MR. DUDLEY.  We have the right to limit our exposure to primary dealers that we have \n",
      "less confidence in.  In fact, that is what we would actually do in the implementation of this kind \n",
      "of program. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions?  President Plosser. \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If I could, I have basically three clarifying \n",
      "questions, a couple of them related to other comments.  The first is on this issue of haircuts and \n",
      "discounts on the collateral.  If I understand from looking at what we do for the TAF and for the \n",
      "discount window, the haircut that is given depends on the duration of the security, and it ranges \n",
      "from 8 percent to 3 percent.  As I think Bill Dudley suggests, it is lowest for very short term \n",
      "duration buckets.  But those haircuts apply, at least in my understanding, only to assets for which \n",
      "there are in fact market prices being quoted somewhere.  For assets that are committed, even \n",
      "AAA assets, for those types of collateralized mortgages where there are no market prices, the \n",
      "haircut is 20 percent.  So are we then accepting only collateral for which market prices in fact \n",
      "exist, or would we be following what we do at the discount window and take a substantially \n",
      "higher haircut for securities that we don’t observe market prices for?  That is my first question. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  My understanding is that we are going to take only securities for which \n",
      "market prices exist.   \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  The second concern— I want to go back to President Fisher’s \n",
      "and President Hoenig’s comments—I am a bit nervous about the slippery slope here.  Once we \n",
      "start taking assets of a particular class that is in distress, are we setting ourselves up for potential \n",
      "risks down the road, when all of a sudden some other asset class that is commonly used in both \n",
      "trading and securities, whether by mutual funds or banks, comes under greater duress and for \n",
      "which spreads widen significantly?  Are we going down a path here in which we are going to \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "13 of 39implicitly provide support for a whole range of potential asset classes?  I worry a bit about where \n",
      "this might lead us over a longer period of time.  That is related to my question.  Maybe I missed \n",
      "it reading the document or in the discussion.  This facility is different from the traditional lending \n",
      "facilities that we have in place primarily because of the term, even for the non-schedule 1 assets.  \n",
      "Are we going to bill this as something different, and if so, does that mean we can remove it at \n",
      "some point?  How long do you anticipate this facility being in place, and how do you think about \n",
      "the magnitude of the operations that we want to open the door for? \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser, I would make just a couple of comments, \n",
      "and Bill can follow.  On the slippery slope, it requires an FOMC vote to add assets.  So if we \n",
      "come to that point, you will have your opportunity to vote “no” or to object.  Again, we don’t \n",
      "propose to do that—but, you know, time consistency.  I’m sorry, what was the other thing?  Oh, \n",
      "you asked about the duration.  The section 13(3) legal basis for this operation requires an \n",
      "affirmation that market conditions are significantly impaired.  If we couldn’t honestly make that \n",
      "affirmation, our legal basis would disappear.  So I think we would have to remove it once \n",
      "conditions had normalized.  Bill, do you have anything to add to that? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  I think you answered the question very well. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Gee, thanks.  [Laughter]  Charlie, did you have other \n",
      "questions?  No?  President Rosengren. \n",
      "MR. ROSENGREN.  I just want to follow up on one of Bill Dudley’s comments.  I \n",
      "noticed in the terms and conditions that it included that the New York Fed reserves the right to \n",
      "reject or declare ineligible any bid entirely at its own discretion.  Under the TAF, we require that \n",
      "people be qualified under the primary credit program.  Are we planning on using a credit \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "14 of 39standard equivalent to what is done for the TAF for the broker–dealer community?  Do we \n",
      "currently have the capacity to make that determination? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  I think the answer to that question is that we are going to make a \n",
      "determination but we don’t have the same level of knowledge about the institution because we \n",
      "are not the primary consolidated supervisor. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto, do you have a question? \n",
      "MS. PIANALTO.  Yes.  I just wanted to clarify that we are being asked to authorize the \n",
      "acceptance of different collateral.  Who determines the size of the lending program on an \n",
      "ongoing basis?  Is that determined by the Desk? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  We are proposing the rough size of the facility today.  As we gain \n",
      "experience with the facility and examine market conditions, we will be keeping the FOMC \n",
      "apprised of the programs and certainly seeking the input of the Committee on how to take this \n",
      "going forward.  I hope that we will get a lot of feedback as we go through this auction process.  \n",
      "If the bidding is very strong and if the markets are under tremendous distress, then we would \n",
      "probably want to increase the size of the program.  Conversely, if the bidding is weak and if the \n",
      "markets settle down, then we would want to wrap up this program pretty quickly. \n",
      "MR. ALVAREZ.  The resolution that the FOMC will be asked to vote on today will have \n",
      "an outside limit of $200 billion as the total size of the term securities lending facility.  If it were \n",
      "to go above that, it would have to come back to the FOMC. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans. \n",
      "MR. EVANS.  President Pianalto asked my question. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Fisher, do you have another question? \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "15 of 39MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.  I want to come back to President Rosengren’s question, just so I \n",
      "understand this.  Bill, let’s take an example.  What I think Eric is referring to is footnote 6 on \n",
      "page 9 of 10:  “The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reserves the right to restrict individual \n",
      "primary dealer use of the program, even at the outset.”  Do we have the capacity, for example, \n",
      "going back to your introductory comments on what happened in the markets, to evaluate Bear \n",
      "Stearns as a participant in this program and to say, “No, you can’t participate”?  If we did that, \n",
      "what would that do to Bear Stearns? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the first thing is that almost all of these primary dealers have the \n",
      "SEC as their primary consolidated supervisor.  So it is important to understand that it is not as \n",
      "though there isn’t an entity looking at the financial strength and stability of these institutions.  \n",
      "We have the right not to accept collateral from any of the primary dealers, should we decide to \n",
      "do that.  It is not going to be public.  We are not going to be making a statement.  This is just \n",
      "going to be a bilateral arrangement between us and the given primary dealer. \n",
      "MR. FISHER.  I guess my concern is that the safety-and-soundness disciplines that we \n",
      "apply don’t appear to be applied to these broker–dealers.  I guess the real question is that we can \n",
      "fly blind for a little time and we can try something—and I am for trying something—but if this \n",
      "doesn’t lead to some broader regulatory authority or some change in the nature of the regulatory \n",

      "of regulation, I just wonder what the end game here is.  Mr. Chairman, I am saying that I think \n",
      "we need to really think that through.  We can react to what we are seeing going on in the \n",

      "hazard concerns.  There are also concerns that this may be just another step along a path that we \n",
      "haven’t really defined well.  That is very important, and I very much agree— actually, I have \n",
      "forgotten who made these comments earlier— that we really need to think about the full path of \n",

      "with these kinds of pressures, dangerous dynamics, in markets that Bill and Don described so well.  \n",
      "This proposal is the best of a bunch of bad options.  It is very hard to know how much effect it is \n",
      "going to have.  It is very possible it will get overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the selling \n",
      "pressure, risk reduction, and forced deleveraging still under way.  It is very hard for us to know now \n",
      "how much of that is necessarily ahead of us, even in a world where there is less uncertainty about \n",
      "the macro outlook.  I think all of you who said this are right.  There’s some risk in doing this that \n",
      "we’ll just face much more pressure to do more.  But I think that pressure will be with us anyway, \n",
      "and it would intensify even without action in this context.  The important thing is that the Congress \n",
      "gave us the authority, although they may not fully have envisioned the world we live in today, to do \n",
      "a range of things to address these kinds of pressures.  Not to use that authority in carefully designed, \n",
      "responsible ways because of the fear that we could not resist pressure to expand is not, in my view, \n",
      "March 10, 2008\n",
      "32 of 39a good argument not to do things that we think would be sensible in mitigating these pressures.  I \n",
      "think we are a stronger institution than we were.  Jeff, you invoked the 1970s.  We’re a substantially \n",
      "stronger institution than then, and we have the ability to decide what we think is enough and what \n",

      "confident we could contain it.”  But I don’t think anybody can sit here and say that today.  I think \n",
      "none of the options out there beyond this look good.  The other options are much worse than this, \n",
      "and if we do not escalate now in this context, I think then we face much more risk that will get to \n",
      "much more uncomfortable options with much worse moral hazard concerns for us and the system as \n",

      " \n",
      "MR. KOHN.  I move that we close the meeting. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  This is a joint Board–FOMC meeting \n",
      "because the issues on liquidity provision that we are going to be discussing today require both \n",
      "Board and FOMC actions. \n",
      "At the last FOMC meeting, the one in June, we discussed briefly some of the facilities—\n",
      "the TAF, the PDCF, and the TSLF—and I think there was an agreement that we would be \n",
      "announcing an extension of those beyond year-end.  At that time, I suggested that we might take \n",
      "a notation vote on those issues.  However, the staff has proposed a couple of additional wrinkles, \n",
      "which would make sense to announce at the same time that we announce an extension.  Because \n",
      "we want to get your views on these, I thank you for taking the time to join this meeting. \n",
      "Two additional suggestions have been made.  The first is to add an auction of options to \n",
      "the TSLF to allow dealers to bid for the option to have access to the TSLF over critical short \n",
      "periods such as over year-end.  We will get more explanation of that.  The second proposal is to \n",
      "extend the maturity of the Term Auction Facility from the current 28 days to 84 days.  As you \n",
      "know, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank have been conducting auctions \n",
      "pursuant to our TAF auctions.  We have contacted them and told them that we are considering \n",
      "the extension in time.  If we do that, they have both indicated that they would want to follow and \n",
      "do three-month auctions with us.  To make that work out, we are going to propose a small \n",
      "increase in the ECB swap line—well, not small, but from $50 billion to $60 billion.  I guess $10 \n",
      "billion is large money anywhere.  The purpose is that they can divide that by six and have a more \n",
      "even number for auctions. \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "3 of 50The reasons I thought that we should discuss this now instead of waiting for the meeting \n",
      "in a couple of weeks are, first, that there is considerable interest in what we are going to do with \n",
      "these various facilities and already some reporting about them, and I think it is better for us to get \n",
      "this out sooner rather than later.  If we decide today to take these steps—in particular, if we \n",
      "decide to lengthen the TAF—for purposes of coordinating with ECB , they would have to get \n",
      "approval from their governors as well.  The bottom line is that our announcement would be next \n",
      "Wednesday morning, so we would not be quite ready to announce for a few more days.  In \n",
      "addition, because I do want everyone to have a chance to give their views and we have only a \n",
      "one-day meeting coming up, I thought it would be better to get this done before the FOMC \n",
      "meeting.  Again, the issue at hand is whether to make these two additional modifications to our \n",
      "liquidity program. \n",

      "will be assisted by Debby Perelmuter and Sandy Krieger.  After that, there will be time for Q&A \n",
      "with them; with Brian, who is here; with Scott Alvarez; or with anyone on the staff.  Following \n",
      "that, we will have an opportunity for discussion.  The votes are actually kind of complicated \n",

      "the meeting to Bill Dudley.  Bill. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As outlined in the memo circulated \n",
      "earlier to the Committee from Brian and myself, the staff is proposing two \n",
      "innovations to our suite of liquidity facilities.  First, we are proposing to add a \n",
      "$50 billion options program to the TSLF.  There is a precedent for this.  We auctioned \n",
      "options in advance of Y2K.  This proposal calls for selling options to primary dealers \n",
      "in a series of auctions beginning several weeks before each quarter-end.  The options \n",
      "would be for the right to borrow Treasuries from the SOMA portfolio in exchange for \n",
      "schedule 2 collateral for a short period of time (a week or so) over the quarter-end \n",
      "period.  If the option is exercised, the dealer would pay a fixed rate for the borrowing \n",
      "(we have currently penciled in this rate at 25 basis points, annualized—the same as \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "4 of 50the minimum bid rate on 28-day TSLF borrowing).  The fine points of the program, \n",
      "such as the rate and the precise timing and tenor of the borrowing that the options \n",
      "would reference, would be determined after consultation with the primary dealer \n",
      "community.  As you recall, in the rollout of the original TSLF program, we consulted \n",
      "with the dealer community after the program was announced.  The dealer comments \n",
      "did result in changes in the program that we believe made it more effective, and the \n",
      "dealers certainly did appreciate the opportunity to have their views heard before the \n",
      "program was implemented.  We anticipate that an options facility would be helpful in \n",
      "providing a means for dealers to purchase insurance that could be used to secure \n",
      "funding over stress periods such as quarter-end and year-end.  Because the options \n",
      "would be auctioned well in advance of quarter-end, dealers should be able to better \n",
      "plan their funding needs over that period.  The options program should help reassure \n",
      "dealers that they will be able to finance their less liquid collateral over these high-\n",
      "stress balance sheet periods.  Greater comfort on the part of the dealers is likely to \n",
      "reduce the risk of a margin spiral in which forced liquidation of illiquid collateral \n",
      "leads to lower prices, higher volatility, and higher haircuts, which, in turn, provoke \n",
      "further liquidation.  Debby Perelmuter will discuss the TSLF options proposal in \n",
      "greater detail in a few minutes.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Second, we are proposing to extend the maturity of Term Auction Facility loans \n",
      "to 84 days from 28 days.  The size of the total program would remain unchanged at \n",
      "$150 billion.  The auction cycle would remain biweekly, with the size of each auction \n",
      "cut proportionately to the rise in maturity—to $25 billion per auction in six biweekly \n",
      "cycles covering 12 weeks from the current program of $75 billion in two biweekly \n",
      "cycles covering four weeks.  We also are proposing to change our \n",
      "overcollateralization rules.  In the current program, we require that TAF bids must not \n",
      "exceed 50 percent of pledged collateral.  But the overcollateralization can be \n",
      "withdrawn after the loans are made.  Under the new rules, we would change this \n",
      "standard so that the sum of all outstanding term TAF and term PCF loans could not \n",
      "exceed 75 percent of available collateral, both initially and throughout the term of the \n",
      "loans.  As the Chairman noted, the ECB and the SNB have indicated that they will \n",
      "modify their programs accordingly.  The ECB is seeking to raise its swap line \n",
      "authority to $60 billion from $50 billion.  They are seeking to do this because the \n",
      "current swap line of $50 billion is not easily divisible into a six biweekly auction \n",
      "cycle.  We anticipate that they will decide to raise their biweekly auction size to either \n",
      "$9 billion or $10 billion—so the total swap draw is likely to rise to either $54 billion \n",
      "or $60 billion.  The motivation for the maturity extension is provide greater support to \n",
      "term funding markets.  For some time, banks have asked for longer-term maturity \n",
      "TAF loans.  This is attractive to them for two reasons:  (1) almost all of these loans \n",
      "will extend over quarter-ends—periods in which ba lance sheet stress is likely to be \n",
      "greatest—and ( 2) the longer maturity would also help banks extend the average \n",
      "maturity of their borrowings.  This change will also put the maturity of TAF loans \n",
      "more on par with the ninety-day limit of the primary credit facility.  Sandy Krieger \n",
      "will discuss our TAF maturity extension proposal in more detail shortly.   \n",

      "5 of 50So what will these two programs do?  My own view is that these new proposals \n",
      "are evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  They are unlikely to result in a dramatic \n",
      "improvement in term funding conditions.  However, they are likely to be helpful at \n",

      "ensuring against margin spiral versus just expanding the TSLF amount?  \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I think one advantage of it is that you are buying an option today \n",

      "the Federal Reserve determines that unusual and exigent conditions exist.  So today if we extend \n",
      "that time table to January 30, 2009, then we are opening up the possibility of having options over \n",
      "the September quarter-end and year-end but no longer.  In terms of the maturity, the banks have \n",

      "the one that is always at the top of the list.   \n",
      "Now, to your question, “Have things deteriorated?” I would say “yes and no.”  They \n",

      "but I wonder whether any thought was given to keeping the 28-day TAF and then adding the \n",
      "longer 84-day TAF.  Is that even an option?  The reason I raise this question is that I am \n",
      "concerned about the credit risk.  We have had situations in which it has been difficult to assess \n",
      "whether an institution was going to stay in sound financial condition over a 28-day period.  \n",
      "Obviously, it would be even more challenging over an 84-day period.  So I just wondered if it 1s \n",

      "completely to an 84-day was that we thought it was much clearer.  In other words, the users \n",
      "would know what they were doing and wouldn’t be faced with a multitude of choices in terms of \n",
      "keeping straight what week this is and what auction they are bidding for today.  So we felt at the \n",
      "end of the day, because we had repeatedly been asked for a longer maturity, that we would be \n",

      "MS. KRIEGER.  In terms of the size of the cushion, we did speak with SCRM \n",
      "(Subcommittee on Credit Risk Management) a bit about this, and, of course, there is a variety of \n",
      "views there; and across the System, as we look at the loans that are outstanding, there is a range \n",
      "of collateral that is used.  A good portion of the collateral that is used is not priced securities; it is \n",
      "loans, many of which we do not have the details on, so it is very difficult to establish a good \n",
      "value.  Then, even behind that in quality are nonpriced securities, and we have increasingly seen \n",
      "more of those pledged to us in these times.  So we felt, because it is difficult for us to feel really \n",
      "comfortable with the values of some of these pledged instruments, that taking the cushion did \n",
      "seem appropriate.  For what it is worth, of the more than $150 billion of loans that we have \n",
      "outstanding, they fall short of being collateralized by this extra margin by only about \n",
      "$200 million.  So virtually all the value can be overcollateralized. \n",
      "Now, it is not quite so pleasing a picture if you look at it by the number of borrowers \n",
      "outstanding.  Of the 140 or some borrowers outstanding, maybe 25 of them are short some \n",
      "margin of collateral, if you would impose the 25 percent overcollateralization.  But, again, the \n",
      "values are quite small, even in percentage terms, for institutions.  So as we try to balance, on the \n",
      "one hand, our comfort with some of the collateral we are taking and our ability to value it with, \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "19 of 50on the other, the longer term, we look to the preference of many in the reserve community who \n",

      "the vast majority of Reserve Banks if we were to introduce the cushion. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  I also want to point out that for the banks that don’t have enough \n",
      "collateral today, that doesn’t mean that they don’t have collateral available.  It is just that the \n",
      "collateral hasn’t been pledged at the window.  So the bottom line is that we don’t think that the \n",
      "overcollateralization requirement is very constraining—to use economics terms, the shadow \n",
      "price of collateral is pretty close to zero as far as we can tell.  \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions?  Well, if there are not any \n",
      "other questions, let me first say that I do want to thank the staff.  These innovations did come \n",
      "from the staff members who are on the front lines.  President Evans, we really have talked about \n",
      "these, and I know the staff has thought these through.  I think that these are constructive ideas.  \n",
      "The option idea essentially will allow for a better targeted use of our balance sheet to some short \n",
      "periods that have been particularly stressful, and I think it will give us overall more flexibility to \n",
      "use our balance sheet in the most effective way.  So it seems like an innovative way to deal with \n",
      "a particular problem, which is this end-of-quarter issue. \n",
      "On the 84-day TAF, I know for sure that banks have been asking for a longer term.  I \n",
      "have heard it directly myself and have heard a lot about this from the Desk.  It is frequently \n",
      "pointed out by the banks that the ECB and the Bank of England have been making effective use \n",
      "of longer-term loans, and in their view that has made the liquidity pressures less severe in those \n",
      "jurisdictions.  So I do think it is certainly worth considering the three-month TAF loan.  \n",
      "Obviously, as Reserve Bank presidents, you have to administer these; and the first question that \n",
      "comes to your mind is, of course, the greater credit risk.  In that respect, I think that taking the \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "20 of 50existing haircuts plus 33 percent should provide some comfort.  Of course, you retain the right \n",
      "always to demand collateral to your satisfaction or to convert the loan to a primary or secondary \n",
      "or overnight loan or to call the loan.  So you have always the same protections that you currently \n",
      "have.  I suppose it would be, in some sense, a de facto tightening of standards, if you were \n",
      "looking at institutions that would be eligible on a three-month basis.  At the same time, to go \n",
      "back to my earlier comment, we don’t have to make a final decision today, but it might be worth \n",
      "considering not putting the overcollateralization requirement on any loan less than, say, 14 or 28 \n",
      "days on the grounds, as President Plosser pointed out, that we don’t want to be seen as taking \n",
      "away something or increasing the cost of funding at a time when we still want to provide these \n",
      "liquidity benefits.  So I guess that one option I would raise for consideration is that, if we do the \n",
      "three-month maturity, we use the overcollateralization for loans greater than 28 days.  This \n",
      "means that, as a loan maturity comes down—as it comes close to payoff—some collateral could \n",
      "be withdrawn if desired. \n",
      "I do think these are reasonable extensions.  They seem to me to be quite consistent with \n",
      "our earlier practice.  I take President Hoenig’s point that we are not in this business indefinitely.  \n",
      "We need to be thinking about cutting back.  But at the moment, conditions do not seem \n",
      "considerably better, and I don’t think that at this moment we really should be reducing our \n",
      "support to the market.  Are there others who would like to comment on any aspect of these \n",
      "proposals—about collateral or about any of the other issues?  President Plosser. \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There are just two other observations I want \n",
      "to share.  They aren’t direct questions, just sort of my thoughts on this.  In general, I am okay \n",
      "with the extension to the 84 days— I don’t think that is problematic.  As I mentioned before in \n",
      "our meetings, I really would like to see some more clarification and standards applied to what the \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "21 of 50Board and the staff mean by “unusual and exigent circumstances,” how we define that term and \n",
      "how we know when it is time to take it off.  I understand that there is stress in the marketplace.  I \n",
      "am not disputing that.  But I think as we go forward—and following up on President Hoeni g’s \n",
      "point—it would be useful if we had a way of discussing more explicitly the criteria that we use to \n",
      "put this on or take it off.  So at some point I would like to have some discussion about that. \n",
      "The other point I would make is that I am just not persuaded by the staff’s arguments \n",
      "about the options.  The TSLF is undersubscribed.  If we wanted to make loans available, we \n",
      "could offer more-frequent auctions.  We aren’t tied to any particular two-week schedule.  We \n",
      "could offer auctions near the end of the quarter.  I am just not convinced that this is going to \n",
      "provide much to the marketplace.  Even the staff suggested that it might be marginal.  The more \n",
      "we tweak and change these things and try to provide things that we don’t know whether they are \n",
      "needed, I am not persuaded that they are adding anything.  I think the 84 days runs over quarter-\n",
      "end.  There are auctions as much as one week or two weeks before quarter-end every quarter.  \n",
      "There are funds available.  So I am just not sure that this is necessary.  Thank you. \n",

      "PDCF, and I am also supportive of the proposal to auction options on TSLF draws.  I think we \n",
      "do continue to have money market stress, particularly at quarter-end, and it strikes me as a well-\n",
      "targeted program that might have some success in addressing the strains. \n",
      "On the proposal to extend the term of the TAF loans to 84 days, I do have some qualms, \n",
      "and they have been heightened by our own recent experience with a failing bank and my sense \n",

      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "22 of 50opposed to it.  But I do think that the program entails credit risk for Reserve Banks and may \n",

      "My anxiety about this has been heightened by our own recent experience with IndyMac.  \n",
      "If you will indulge me for a second, I will tell you the story of what happened there and why I \n",

      "information provided to us by the OTS indicated that IndyMac was a CAMELS 2–rated \n",
      "institution.  We monitored Call Report data that showed it to be well capitalized.  On the \n",
      "morning of June 26, we approved a loan for $1 billion under primary credit.  IndyMac didn’t \n",
      "participate in TAF auctions, but it was eligible to do so.  If the new 84-day facility had been in \n",
      "operation, it would hypothetically have been eligible to be covered under that.  It could have had \n",
      "an 84-day TAF loan. \n",
      "My staff consulted with me on the IndyMac request on that morning of June 26 because it \n",
      "represented a significant escalation in borrowing, and our own monitoring suggested that the \n",
      "institution had been deteriorating.  We had informal hints of some concerns at the OTS.  It was \n",
      "unknown to us, but in point of fact the OTS had already informed the institution that it had \n",
      "actually been downgraded to a 3.  Even so, even if we had known that, it still would have been \n",
      "eligible for primary credit and participation in a TAF auction. \n",
      "Now, the memo we got points out that we can disqualify an institution from participation \n",
      "in a TAF auction on the grounds that we judge it to be in unsound financial condition or that we \n",
      "can on such a judgment move an institution to secondary credit.  But we thought that would be a \n",
      "drastic action, and it probably would have been seen as arbitrary.  It would have entailed a \n",

      "and make independent judgments on the health of all those institutions on an ongoing basis.  We \n",
      "do have to rely on primary supervisors for assessments.  If we act on our own hunches, we are \n",
      "substituting our judgment for that of primary supervisors.  If we decided we wanted to do so, we \n",
      "would be truly taxing the resources of our colleagues in BS&R beyond their capacity to deal with \n",
      "these institutions.  Third, we may think that we are overcollateralized, but that judgment can be \n",
      "highly flawed in the case of a troubled institution.  Finally, while we may, in principle, demand \n",
      "immediate repayment of any discount window loan, including a TAF term credit, in a failing-\n",

      "We had an experience with the OTS, and we found that their rating plus 1 was the rating we \n",

      "own independent assessment.  Our guys did a great job.  I have to commend them—they did a lot \n",
      "of work.  But it was a strain on our staff.  I do think, if lending is going to play such a large role \n",

      "MS. YELLEN.  There was about $1 billion of uninsured deposits out of roughly $30 billion \n",

      "assets and that great losses would have been taken in selling assets on that time frame to cover \n",
      "withdrawals.  On balance we accepted the idea that the FDIC was going to close it within a two-\n",

      "broad facilities that we’ve already put in place.  So I would suggest that maybe we’d want to \n",
      "separate that from the broader discussion. \n",
      "As for the most optimal mix of liquidity facilities, I’m convinced that what we have is \n",
      "imperfect.  It has had some beneficial effect, but it can be improved upon.  Exactly how we judge \n",
      "those improvements— the standards by which we come to a determination, which will necessarily \n",

      "that question from the extension question that you raised at the outset.  Thank you. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Is there anyone who hasn’t spoken who would \n",
      "like to speak?  Governor Mishkin. \n",
      "MR. MISHKIN.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the basic point that it’s very \n",
      "important to recognize that we do not want a lot of these facilities to be permanent and that at some \n",
      "point we will need to remove them.  I do worry about the issue of creating the kind of moral hazard \n",
      "from an idiosyncratic viewpoint, and that’s very different.  There are two aspects to moral hazard.  \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "41 of 50One is moral hazard that is created by providing a backstop when there’s a systemic problem.  But \n",
      "you expand this tremendously if you have a backstop for an idiosyncratic episode or for \n",

      "On the other hand, I just don’t see the stress dissipating.  I’m getting ready to go back to \n",

      "disruptions or crisis episodes in terms of the length and the fact that it really hasn’t gotten better.  \n",
      "We keep on having shoes dropping.  So although there’s an issue that we’re going to need to get out \n",
      "of many of these facilities, the reality is that we’re in this, and I’m not anticipating that this is going \n",
      "to go away quickly.  I hope that it will.  I just don’t understand the argument that actually thinking \n",
      "of more ways to be on top of this and being creative about it will indicate that we want to do \n",

      "have to do to basically make sure that we’re managing credit risks better, particularly with an \n",
      "extension of the maturity of the TAF loans, but I do not think that this is a situation in which we can \n",
      "just sit back and get everything perfect before we put in these facilities. \n",
      "So there are a lot of issues here.  Maybe just because I’m having a bit more trouble sleeping \n",
      "at night, I am supportive of going in this direction.  I think that we have to keep on pushing, and I \n",

      "still quite stressed and that this would be helpful.  It has the additional sort of multiplier effect that, \n",
      "if we extend to three months, the ECB will auction $60 billion to three months as well, to give some \n",
      "additional impetus in Europe.  That said, I do not feel comfortable doing this unless we have at least \n",
      "a reasonable sense that the presidents are okay with it.  So after we finish the first three votes, I’ll \n",

      "to which President Geithner and Governor Kroszner alluded, to address the credit issues that we \n",
      "already face in our 28-day program, do you feel comfortable in doing the 84 days?  If you do not, \n",
      "then my suggestion would be just not to go forward with it. \n",

      "into a 28-day and an 84-day so that you would have the option of directing a bank to the 28-day if \n",
      "that were your decision?  Let me ask people just to get a quick response.  President Rosengren. \n",
      "MR. ROSENGREN.  I support this recommendation. \n",

      "question? \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly. \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  It doesn’t affect how I come out on this, but if I understand the \n",
      "conversations, if we made an 84-day loan and if during the period we found the institution’s \n",
      "condition deteriorating, we could in the Reserve Bank’s judgment change that to a primary credit \n",
      "loan, call that loan if we felt it necessary, have conversations with the primary supervisor, and deal \n",
      "with that loan whether it was 84 days or 28 days.  That is my understanding.  Is that correct? \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is correct. \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren, did you say you support the proposal? \n",

      "46 of 50VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I am comfortable supporting the 84-day extension, and I \n",
      "would be supportive of splitting it.  But I’d like to think a little more about both operational issues \n",
      "and how that would work.  In principle, since I would be comfortable with 84, I would be \n",
      "comfortable with two tranches or two windows. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Plosser. \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I’m comfortable with 84, but I also have some sympathy for the \n",
      "view of having two tranches, and 28 and 84 would be fine with me as well. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto. \n",
      "MS. PIANALTO.  My preference is to have the two options, the 28-day and the 84-day.  As \n",
      "I expressed earlier, I am concerned that, even with improving the collateral and surveillance aspects, \n",
      "the 84-day still presents some challenges.  So if it is operationally feasible, I would prefer having the \n",
      "two options of 28 and 84 days. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I don’t think we should do the 84.  If we have to, I’d rather have the \n",
      "28-day option.  I have a procedural question.  The original Term Auction Facility authorizations \n",
      "required action by all the Reserve Bank boards of directors.  Would this modification also require \n",
      "their consent? \n",
      "MR. ALVAREZ.  The only action by the Reserve Bank board of directors on the original \n",

      "talking about and the conversations, that we would end up being able to do it appropriately.  I would \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. \n",
      "MS. YELLEN.  Yes.  Well, while I expressed some qualms, I’m comfortable with the \n",

      "comfortable with the proposal. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Bill, are you having any issues with the feasibility of splitting \n",
      "it? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the big problem would be how we would make the transition, \n",
      "because I think we cannot do two auctions simultaneously on 84 days and 28 days and it’s not clear \n",
      "how one would actually transition then to steady state.  We would have to spend some time working \n",
      "on that to see if it is possible to make this happen without having a lot of reserve-management issues \n",
      "July 24, 2008\n",
      "48 of 50because we really don’t want the outstanding amounts to go up or down violently as we’re \n",
      "transitioning.  So we’re just going to have to see if that’s feasible or not. \n",
      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Just to underscore, Mr. Chairman, what I said, I think \n",
      "President Evans is right— I would not be prepared to make a recommendation today on 28 alongside \n",
      "84.  I think it just needs a little more time, not a lot more time, but we have to think through it to \n",
      "make sure we can do it.  We have to come back to you and explain how we think we would manage \n",
      "through those issues, if we think they’re manageable.  One thing we might do is use the SCRM \n",
      "process that exists to expose them in a little more depth to whatever our thinking collectively here is \n",
      "on the operational issues and the signal issues, and we can probably do something quickly on that \n",
      "tomorrow.  But I think we need to reflect a bit and come back to you. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So let’s do this.  Let’s have Bill and his team look at the \n",
      "feasibility of a split auction.  Let’s have any discussions we might have about how we might \n",

      "improve our surveillance.  There will have to be notation votes if we decide to go forward.  The \n",
      "extension of the TAF would be a Board vote, but we also would need the FOMC to approve an \n",

      "Janet? \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have three topics to raise with you today.  First, financial \n",
      "market conditions, as you know, remain quite strained, and in response to that we are proposing \n",
      "some additional liquidity measures.  Mostly this is informational.  However, we are proposing to \n",
      "increase the swap lines fairly significantly, and although you have authorized the Foreign Currency \n",
      "Subcommittee to take those actions, we thought that, given the size of the change, it would be \n",
      "worthwhile to bring this back to you for your attention and your vote just to get the Committee’s \n",
      "agreement on this issue.  The second issue is Wachovia.  As you may have heard, Wachovia was \n",
      "purchased, or there’s a plan to purchase, by Citigroup this morning.  To facilitate that purchase, the \n",
      "Board invoked the systemic risk exception, which has not been done before.  So we want to give \n",
      "you a chance to catch up on what’s going on there.  Then third, we want to talk a bit about interest \n",
      "on reserves, which will be provided in the Paulson financial rescue bill, which is supposed to be up \n",
      "for a vote on Wednesday.  I just want to brief you on what we’re planning in that regard.  So let me \n",
      "start by turning to Bill Dudley in New York.  Bill, if you could give us a brief overview of the \n",
      "financial conditions that motivate these actions, review the actions we’re proposing, and take Q&A, \n",
      "that would be very helpful. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with the foreign \n",
      "exchange swap lines, and then I’ll talk a bit about the TAF increases and about the \n",
      "balance sheet.  I think Brian later is going to talk about interest on reserves in more \n",
      "detail.   \n",
      " \n",
      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "3 of 16All of the foreign central banks that have obtained dollar swap lines in response to \n",
      "dollar funding pressures in their home markets have decided, with some encouragement \n",
      "on our part, to seek an increase in the size of these swap line authorizations.  We just \n",
      "have to hear from the Bank of Japan— I think that’s the only one that’s outstanding— but \n",
      "we expect to hear that shortly.  The actual draws on these lines may turn out to be \n",
      "considerably less, and the amounts that are actually drawn are likely to depend on \n",
      "market conditions.  The large increase in authorization should be considered as \n",
      "insurance in case market conditions continue to deteriorate and as reassurance to market \n",
      "participants that the world’s major central banks are determined to respond in force to \n",
      "mitigate dollar funding pressures.  By foreign central banks, the current lines are being \n",
      "doubled for the larger participants and tripled for the smaller participants.  The increases \n",
      "are as follows, very quickly:  the Bank of Canada, $30 billion from $10 billion; the Bank \n",
      "of England, $80 billion from $40 billion; the Bank of Japan, $120 billion from \n",
      "$60 billion; the National Bank of Denmark, $15 billion from $5 billion; the ECB, \n",
      "$240 billion from $120 billion; the Bank of Norway, $15 billion from $5 billion; the \n",
      "Reserve Bank of Australia, $30 billion from $10 billion; the Swedish Riksbank, \n",
      "$30 billion from $10 billion; and the Swiss National Bank, $60 billion from $30 billion.  \n",
      "Adding up all of this would result in an increase in our swap line authorization to \n",
      "$620 billion from $290 billion previously.  I think that these decisions have been made \n",
      "in response to the increasing turmoil evident in interbank markets, especially for dollar \n",
      "funding; and by increasing the size of the authorization significantly, the intention is to \n",
      "reassure market participants that sufficient dollar funding will be available well into \n",
      "2009. \n",
      " \n",
      "The staff believes that these large increases are appropriate to reassure market \n",
      "participants that the world’s central banks are prepared to take extraordinary steps as \n",
      "needed to address ongoing strains in financial markets.  These strains are evident in a \n",
      "number of ways.  First, we’ve seen a sharp rise in overnight dollar funding rates and in \n",
      "term LIBOR–OIS spreads.  For example, on Friday, the three-month LIBOR–OIS \n",
      "spread was over 200 basis points, and in fact, LIBOR may actually understate the degree \n",
      "of funding pressure.  The NYFR index, which is the U.S.-based alternative to LIBOR, \n",
      "has actually been much higher than LIBOR over the past week or two.  So LIBOR \n",
      "actually may be understated.  Second, there have been many anecdotal reports of a \n",
      "withdrawal of counterparties’ willingness to engage in term funding activity.  So the \n",
      "tenor of almost all activity in the market now is overnight.  Third, there are growing \n",
      "liquidity strains at major financial institutions.  Obviously, Wachovia is part of that \n",
      "story.  Fourth, we’ve seen a significant rise in the demand for our TSLF and TAF credit.  \n",
      "For example, the stop-out rate for the most recent TAF auction, which was a 28-day \n",
      "maturity auction, was 3.75 percent, significantly above the one-month LIBOR rate at the \n",
      "time.  Fifth, we’ve seen a sharp rise in PCF and PDCF borrowings.  For example, on the \n",
      "week ending last Wednesday, PCF credit was $39.4 billion, an increase of about \n",
      "$18 billion from the previous week, and PDCF borrowing was $88 billion in the latest \n",
      "week, up $68 billion from the previous week.  Last, European banking strains have been \n",
      "increasingly evident in recent days, especially this weekend following the announcement \n",
      "of the Fortis rescue and the nationalization of B&B in the United Kingdom.  The \n",
      "European banking news has led to a sharp drop in the European equity markets— this \n",
      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "4 of 16morning they’re down 2 to 3 percent— and the euro and sterling exchange rates have \n",
      "dropped quite sharply against the dollar, down about 2 percent. \n",
      " \n",
      "Now, along with this increase in authorized swap lines, Chairman Bernanke has \n",
      "approved the staff recommendation for a large increase in our term auction facility \n",
      "(TAF) program.  We are proposing two changes in the TAF program.  First, we’re \n",
      "proposing to increase the 84-day TAF auction sizes to $75 billion per auction, from $25 \n",
      "billion.  That will start with the next 84-day auction that was scheduled for October 6.  \n",
      "The second change is that the Chairman has approved two forward TAF auctions \n",
      "totaling $150 billion.  These auctions would take place in November, and they would \n",
      "auction short-dated TAF funds for one-week or two-week terms over year-end.  \n",
      "Together, these two changes to the TAF program would increase the supply of TAF \n",
      "credit to $450 billion, from $150 billion currently.  The notion is that a larger \n",
      "commitment to TAF funding should help ameliorate market concerns about the \n",
      "availability of term funding and about the availability of such funding over year-end.  \n",
      "The effective dates for the swap lines and all the programs will be extended, I think, to \n",
      "April 30, 2009.  This would enable the foreign central banks to extend 84-day TAF \n",
      "credit through year-end under their swap agreements. \n",
      " \n",
      "Obviously, these commitments are likely to put considerable further strain on the \n",
      "Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In recent days we have been offsetting the large \n",
      "reserve additions with the Treasury SFP (supplementary financing program) cash-\n",
      "management bill issuance.  After this week’s scheduled bill issuance, the total amount of \n",
      "outstanding SFP obligations will reach $400 billion.  However, we cannot rely on this \n",
      "program indefinitely because the Treasury’s room under the debt limit ceiling is about \n",
      "$900 billion as of early last week and is shrinking rapidly because of the SFP and other \n",
      "ongoing funding commitments. \n",
      " \n",
      "PARTICIPANT.  It’s impossible to hear.   \n",
      "MR. FISHER.  Someone has had a BlackBerry on during the last two or three sentences. \n",
      "MS. DANKER.  New York, in particular, could you make sure you have no cell phones or \n",

      "MR. DUDLEY.  I’ll make sure everything is off.  Probably I’m the culprit.  Poetic \n",
      "justice.  Let me just repeat the last stuff on the SFP.  After this week’s scheduled bill \n",
      "issuance, the total amount of SFP obligations will be $400 billion.  We can’t keep \n",
      "relying on that program indefinitely, though, because the Treasury’s room under the \n",
      "debt limit ceiling, which was $900 billion as of early last week, is shrinking rapidly \n",
      "because of that program and other ongoing funding commitments.  So that’s where the \n",
      "interest on reserves legislation comes in.  Assuming that the Congress enacts that \n",
      "legislation this week, we will be able to pay interest on reserves.  I’ll leave that to Brian \n",

      "5 of 16CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  So just to clarify, we’ll be asking you for the following \n",
      "two actions after the question-and-answer period.  One is, again, that although the Foreign Currency \n",
      "Subcommittee was authorized to increase swaps, because we are essentially doubling the \n",
      "outstanding swap lines, we would like to go back to the Committee for a vote, or to hear your views, \n",
      "to get approval for those swap lines, which pending approval, we plan to announce shortly, right? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  At 10 a.m. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, very shortly.  The other thing, which also requires a vote, \n",
      "is that, in order to do three-month swaps over year-end, some of the three-month swaps would go \n",
      "beyond January 30.  So we’re asking for the extension not for all programs but only for the swap \n",

      "deleveraging of the financial system that we’re trying to make take place in an orderly fashion but \n",
      "we can’t resist the natural forces that have to take place?  Thank you. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  I think that’s correct.  Our strategy all along has been not to prevent the \n",
      "deleveraging or the unwinding that developed earlier but to stretch it out a little so fewer things \n",
      "break.  The swap lines are just one more tool to help that process unfold without severe systemic \n",
      "consequences occurring.  Obviously, things are breaking, even with all the tools that we’ve rolled \n",
      "out.  So I think that just suggests that more force needs to be applied.  Clearly, confidence in the \n",
      "markets is extraordinarily poor and fragile, and that’s another reason that an escalation in the \n",
      "authorizations is important—to reassure people that the central banks are prepared to be there, if \n",
      "necessary. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Of course, for the balance sheet— and we’ll discuss that also \n",
      "with interest on reserves— it has the benefit of having zero credit risk because the other central \n",
      "banks are our counterparties.  President Evans, did you have another comment?   \n",
      "MR. EVANS.  Well, I suppose you answered my question there.  It just seems that, in \n",
      "looking at the TAF auctions, there are a number of foreign institutions that, because I don’t follow \n",
      "it, I’m not familiar with, and these are the types of institutions that are borrowing under these \n",
      "agreements.  But I suppose that the foreign central banks are careful with their counterparties. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  If there are no questions, since Bill \n",
      "has to go and get ready for the announcement— sorry, President Plosser. \n",

      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "10 of 16MR. ALVAREZ.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On Friday, Wachovia experienced \n",
      "significant liquidity pressures, and its management concluded that it would have \n",
      "difficulty funding itself this week.  So the board of directors of Wachovia authorized the \n",
      "management to begin entertaining merger offers.  Wells Fargo and Citi quickly emerged \n",
      "as the leading candidates among a group of candidates, but by Sunday it became clear \n",
      "that those two, which were the only remaining candidates by Sunday, could accomplish \n",
      "the merger only with government assistance.  For a variety of reasons, the Board \n",
      "believed that it was appropriate to implement the systemic risk exception to give the \n",
      "FDIC the widest flexibility to resolve Wachovia in order to maintain confidence in the \n",
      "banking system.  Among the reasons was the concern about liquidity pressures that \n",
      "would be felt by similarly situated banking institutions if there was a disorderly or very \n",
      "focused failure of Wachovia.  Also, there was concern that, because Wachovia looked so \n",
      "strong on a capital basis and it would be somewhat surprising to some in the market \n",
      "when it closed, it would send a bad signal about similarly situated institutions.  There \n",
      "was also concern about the large amount of foreign deposits that would be left behind in \n",
      "a least-cost resolution; the potential for money market mutual funds, which are already \n",
      "in a fragile state, to have further disruption from a least-cost resolution; and that the \n",
      "current financial turmoil and weakened economy would be further weakened if the least-\n",
      "cost solution was pursued and that might undermine business and household confidence. \n",
      " \n",
      "The FDIC and the Treasury both agreed with that analysis, and the Secretary \n",
      "consulted with the President, and the systemic risk exception was invoked on Sunday \n",
      "late afternoon.  After a bidding process that was run by the FDIC between Citi and \n",
      "Wells Fargo, Citi emerged as the better bid for Wachovia.  You may have seen this \n",
      "morning a report about that bid.  Citi offered slightly more than $2 billion to the existing \n",
      "shareholders.  Plus it would buy out all of the banks from underneath Wachovia and \n",
      "leave A.G. Edwards and Evergreen, the two investment banking firms of Wachovia, \n",
      "with the existing shareholders.  Citi identified a portfolio of largely real estate–related \n",
      "assets that was about $312 billion in size that it felt it could not handle without some \n",
      "loss-sharing with the FDIC.  It proposed to the FDIC that Citi would take a $54 billion \n",
      "first loss position, and then it asked the FDIC to share losses—a ctually to take losses on \n",
      "the portfolio— above the $54 billion mark.  The FDIC’s analysis of that was that the \n",
      "$54 billion cushion was sufficient to allow the FDIC on its average basis to emerge with \n",
      "little or no loss, and so the FDIC accepted that bid. \n",
      " \n",
      "The Board was asked to give some capital relief to Citi in connection with this and \n",
      "did agree to give relief at the holding company level from the tier 1 regulatory ratio and \n",
      "the leverage ratio for approximately $270 billion worth of assets that would come over \n",
      "from Wachovia to Citi.  That capital relief will be amortized over time and is similar in \n",
      "many ways to the relief that was granted in the Bear Stearns transaction.  An application \n",
      "will be filed shortly for the merger.  The two parties are still working out the details of \n",
      "the merger agreement, but they expect to have it done in the next day or so.  That’s all. \n",
      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Scott?  President Lacker, would you \n",
      "like to add anything? \n",
      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "11 of 16MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Wachovia was losing about $1 billion in deposits a day on average \n",
      "over the past couple of weeks.  They have liquidity to last under a calm scenario this week only until \n",
      "maybe Thursday or Friday.  They probably would have needed discount window borrowing in the \n",
      "middle of the week; but given the news, they were affected by the WaMu closure because of what \n",
      "that did to senior debt holders, and they began experiencing companies pulling away from them in \n",
      "the middle of the day on Friday.  So they were sort of caught up in the wake after WaMu.  They \n",
      "didn’t think they could survive without a lot of support today.  So they were very committed to \n",
      "doing something over the weekend.  They have $64 billion plus in collateral, lendable value pledged \n",
      "at the discount window.  They have $12.5 billion outstanding at the TAF, some of that 28-day, some \n",
      "of that in the two 84-day auctions, and we will leave them on primary credit, and they’ll retain that \n",
      "TAF credit.  We intend issuing an announcement later this morning that says something like, “In \n",
      "support of this transition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stands ready to provide liquidity \n",
      "as needed.” \n",
      "So they have $52 billion in lendable value net of the TAF money.  They have $150 billion in \n",
      "uninsured deposits, and as for other numbers, the market cap at the end of the day Friday was a little \n",
      "over $21 billion.  Evergreen Investments, Wachovia Securities, and A.G. Edwards have a value of \n",
      "about $12 billion.  This leaves shareholders of the holding company with about $14 billion in value.  \n",
      "Wachovia was trading at about $1 this morning after trading at about $10 per share last Friday.  I’m \n",
      "not sure people understand the Edwards and Evergreen part, but we’re monitoring the situation very \n",
      "closely and have people on their desk right now. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  We’ll take questions for either Scott or \n",

      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "12 of 16MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question about the $300 billion of \n",
      "mortgage assets referred to that were segregated out, and the FDIC said that Citi will take the first \n",
      "$54 billion.  Does anybody know whether that is current market value?  What is the $300 billion?  \n",
      "Is it market price, or was it face value?  How was that valued— do we know? \n",
      "MR. ALVAREZ.  The $312 billion was the value on the books of Wachovia, and so Citi is \n",
      "providing the cushion in several ways.  One is marking them down $30 billion to begin with, to be \n",
      "more in line with what Citi’s own marks are and to add to reserves to supplement the potential \n",
      "losses there.  Then the rest is a loss-sharing. \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  Does the first $30 billion markdown come out of the $54 billion? \n",
      "MR. ALVAREZ.  Yes. \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  So they have already taken roughly $30 billion of the $54 billion losses \n",

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, this may be a conversation for another day, but it seems to \n",
      "me that we’re ending up with more and more concentration—Bank of America, Citicorp, Morgan—\n",
      "and I’m curious as to what we plan longer term so as not to displace the ability of other institutions \n",
      "to play their role in the financial markets and grow their businesses— the super-regionals that are \n",
      "healthy and so on.  But I guess just philosophically what concerns me longer term is that, in \n",
      "response to these actions, there are no other people to take these steps, but we’re creating larger and \n",
      "larger concentrations and bigger and bigger situations where we have too big to fail.  I’d just like at \n",
      "some point to have a conversation on that matter.  I’m not objecting to the move taken, obviously, \n",
      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "13 of 16but it is going to present a bigger problem as we go down the path because we’re getting increasing \n",
      "concentration in fewer and fewer institutions.  Just a comment.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me just add that I share your concern.  There is an \n",
      "increasing concentration.  On the other hand, you could also view it as part of a process of \n",
      "consolidation as well, as we have reduced the number of independent investment banks, for \n",
      "example.  But I agree with that.  We have been very constrained throughout this entire crisis, as you \n",
      "know, by the existing facilities for dealing with failing institutions and mergers being one of the \n",
      "only tools we have.  Going forward, I think there is some hope in the near term under the new \n",
      "TARP, which would allow resolutions using capital injections basically without necessarily doing a \n",
      "merger.  Then subsequently, I think it’s very important, as we look toward restructuring our \n",
      "financial regulatory system, to develop good resolution mechanisms and to think about the issues of \n",
      "concentration and too big to fail.  So I take your point, basically. \n",
      "MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions for Scott or for Jeff?  All right.  If not, let \n",
      "me turn to our last item on the agenda, which is interest on reserves.  The TARP legislation provides \n",
      "for that, and Brian will talk a bit about how we might use that. \n",
      "MR. MADIGAN.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  As the Chairman indicated, the TARP \n",
      "legislation includes a provision that accelerates the effective date of the authority to pay \n",
      "interest on reserves from October 1, 2011, to October 1, 2008.  The Federal Reserve \n",
      "staff believes that we’re ready to start paying interest on reserve balances beginning with \n",
      "the reserve maintenance period that starts on October 9.   Assuming that the legislation is \n",
      "passed by the Congress and signed by the President later this week, we plan to \n",
      "recommend shortly thereafter to the Board that the Board direct the Reserve Banks to \n",
      "begin paying interest on reserves on October 9.  Specifically, we plan to suggest that \n",
      "required reserve balances be remunerated at a rate of the target federal funds rate less \n",
      "10 basis points, and more significantly in current circumstances, that excess reserve \n",
      "balances be remunerated initially at a rate of the target federal funds rate less 50 basis \n",
      "points.  We anticipate that the spread between the excess reserves rate and the target \n",
      "federal funds rate may well need to be adjusted over time, but we’re suggesting a \n",
      "50 basis point spread initially.  We’re proposing no other significant changes to the \n",
      "September 29, 2008\n",
      "14 of 16reserve maintenance framework at this time, although we’ll be recommending a few \n",
      "relatively technical changes that are motivated by the ability to pay interest on reserves.  \n",
      "In more normal circumstances, we’d think of the system that we’re recommending at \n",
      "this time as being a type of a corridor system but with required reserves.  The primary \n",
      "credit rate should set the ceiling for the federal funds rate; the excess reserves rate \n",
      "should set the floor. \n",
      " \n",
      "In the current circumstances, though, it may turn out that the system will operate \n",
      "more like what we have been calling a floor system in which the gap between the target \n",
      "federal funds rate and the excess reserves rate is narrow.  This is because, as was \n",
      "discussed earlier, our tools to absorb reserves provided by, again, various lending \n",
      "operations could be constrained given the limited remaining capacity to sell securities \n",
      "and possibly reluctance on the part of Treasury to expand further the supplementary \n",
      "financing program.  In any case, the interest rate on excess reserves should put a floor—\n",
      "possibly a soft floor, but a floor— under the funds rate and thereby allow the Federal \n",
      "Reserve to conduct monetary policy appropriately while providing liquidity consistent \n",
      "with financial stability.  I would note that the overall reserve maintenance framework \n",
      "will remain very complex, possibly overly complex.  The staff plans to continue the \n",
      "study that we presented to the Reserve Bank presidents and the Board members earlier \n",
      "this year, and at some point, we expect to bring significant further changes to the \n",
      "policymakers for consideration.  But for now, we think that the changes that we’re \n",
      "proposing will make effective use of the authority that we expect we’ll have beginning \n",

      "MR. LACKER.  Yes, Brian.  So at 50 basis points under the target rate for excess, it sounds \n",
      "as though your philosophy here is just to limit the tails of the intraday funds rate distribution rather \n",
      "than to attract a lot of funds and replace the Treasury program.  Is that accurate?  I mean, how do \n",
      "you intend to approach that question? \n",
      "MR. MADIGAN.  President Lacker, I think we’re going to need to proceed somewhat \n",
      "adaptively.  We’ll be going from one type of system, in which there has been no remuneration on \n",
      "excess reserves, to one with a rate that’s fairly close to— 50 basis points under— the federal funds \n",
      "rate.  My guess is that it could attract a substantial increase in banks’ interest in holding excess \n",

      "September 29, 2008\n",

      "the excess reserves rate as we get experience, and we may, indeed, have to do that if our ability to \n",
      "drain reserves is otherwise constrained.  We may need to use the excess reserves rate as the way to \n",

      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Let’s begin.  Thank you all for joining this meeting.  \n",
      "We’re having a lot of meetings off the regular cycle.  I think it’s just a sign of the extraordinary \n",
      "times that we’re currently living through.  The only agenda item for this meeting is the discussion of \n",
      "a proposed coordinated action with five other major central banks.  It will be a six-bank coordinated \n",
      "action.  Besides ourselves, the other banks involved are the European Central Bank, the Bank of \n",
      "England, and the Bank of Canada, and since I spoke to you, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank \n",
      "of Sweden have joined in this collective action.  Japan has its own issues and will not be cutting but \n",
      "will be expressing support and has been consulted.  The plan, conditional on our approval, would be \n",
      "for all six major central banks to cut policy rates by 50 basis points jointly and announce tomorrow \n",
      "at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time before the U.S. markets open.  There are two statements.  There’s a short \n",
      "joint statement by all of the central banks, which has been negotiated.  I don’t know if you have \n",
      "access to it.  I will read it to you shortly, if necessary.  Then it is proposed that we have our own \n",
      "short statement, which I know has been circulated and which you should have in front of you.   \n",
      "So that’s the issue we’re here to discuss.  My proposal would be, first, to begin with some \n",
      "short briefings by the staff.  Bill Dudley in New York, Larry Slifman here at the Board, and Nathan \n",
      "Sheets here at the Board would just give us a short update on what’s transpiring in the financial \n",
      "markets and the broader economy.  We will have an opportunity for Q&A with the staff.  I’d then \n",
      "like to introduce the subject briefly and just talk about the rationale, and the floor will be open for \n",
      "your comments on the action, on the economy, and on the statement, as you see fit.  So without \n",
      "further ado, let me turn to Bill Dudley.  Bill, are you there? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Despite our massive escalation \n",
      "on the liquidity provision front and passage of legislation granting the Treasury authority \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "3 of 30to set up a $700 billion troubled asset relief program, or TARP, market conditions \n",
      "continue to deteriorate.  This is occurring in three broad respects. \n",
      " \n",
      "First, market participants continue to pull back in their willingness to engage with \n",
      "one another.  This pullback is evident in elevated interbank lending rates and elevated \n",
      "foreign exchange swap bases and market liquidity more generally.  The one-month and \n",
      "three-month LIBOR–OIS spreads have widened to 271 and 296 basis points, \n",
      "respectively.  That is up more than 175 basis points in the past three weeks since the \n",
      "September 16 FOMC meeting.  The all-in cost of dollar funding via the foreign \n",
      "exchange swap market, although bouncing around day to day, has actually been even \n",
      "higher than LIBOR, often by 100 basis points or more.  In addition to the interbank \n",
      "market, the commercial paper market has come under stress.  The breaking of the buck \n",
      "by the Reserve Fund led to a wholesale flight out of prime institutional money market \n",
      "funds.  This forced the liquidation of assets, which has led to impairment of the \n",
      "commercial paper market.  Term commercial paper rates are elevated, and the average \n",
      "tenor of commercial paper has shortened considerably. \n",
      " \n",
      "Second, financial conditions continue to tighten, and in recent weeks, the tightening \n",
      "has been substantial.  Equity prices have plunged both in the United States and abroad.  \n",
      "Corporate bond yields, especially for non-investment-grade debt, have increased \n",
      "substantially.  Short- and long-term tax-exempt rates have climbed, and credit \n",
      "availability has been even further impaired.  On the equity market side, for example, the \n",
      "S&P 500 index has fallen about 18 percent since the September 16 FOMC meeting.  \n",
      "Although there is considerable uncertainty about the appropriate metrics and weights to \n",
      "use in examining the evolution of financial conditions over time, most data are \n",
      "consistent with the judgment that conditions have tightened significantly since the onset \n",
      "of the crisis, despite the 325 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target.  \n",
      "Compared with the previous two monetary policy easing cycles, there have been four \n",
      "important divergences.  First, corporate bond yields have climbed.  In previous cycles, \n",
      "the widening credit spreads were more than offset by the decline in Treasury note and \n",
      "bond yields, causing corporate bond yields to fall.  Second, credit availability has \n",
      "declined greatly in this cycle.  In the two previous cycles, the proportion of banks \n",
      "tightening credit standards actually fell through the easing cycle.  That stands in sharp \n",
      "contrast to what has been happening in this cycle.  Third, housing price declines have \n",
      "been far larger than in previous cycles, in real and in nominal terms.  Fourth, the dollar \n",
      "has weakened actually much less than in the previous two easing cycles. \n",
      " \n",
      "The third aspect of the market that I think warrants noting is that the U.S. financial \n",
      "sector in particular remains under pressure, especially with respect to share prices and \n",
      "banks’ ability to obtain funding, especially term funding.  Today was a particularly bad \n",
      "day for financial shares, with double-digit declines common for many banks.  The only \n",
      "good news was that credit default swaps actually narrowed a bit, maybe helped by the \n",
      "introduction of our commercial paper backstop facility or the fact that we’ve escalated \n",
      "so massively in terms of the term auction facility and the foreign exchange swaps with \n",
      "our foreign central bank counterparts.   \n",
      " \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "4 of 30On the inflation side of the ledger, pressures continue to abate.  Since the last FOMC \n",
      "meeting, both industrial and agricultural commodity price indexes have fallen about \n",
      "15 percent.  At the same time, the dollar has strengthened.  The fall in the commodity \n",
      "prices and the strength in the dollar are two factors that have contributed to a fall in \n",
      "breakeven measures of inflation on both the spot and the five-year, five-year-forward \n",
      "basis.  For example, the Barclays measure of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven \n",
      "inflation has declined more than 60 basis points since the September FOMC meeting.  \n",
      "Today it was around 1.5 percent. \n",
      " \n",
      "The interbank, money market, and capital market dysfunction, the tightening of \n",
      "financial conditions, and the apparent easing in inflation risks have caused investors to \n",
      "conclude that the FOMC is likely to lower its federal funds rate target in the near future.  \n",
      "Late today, the November federal funds futures contract implied an effective rate for the \n",
      "coming month of about 1.4 percent.  That’s more than 50 basis points below the current \n",
      "target.  Interestingly, the failure of the FOMC to ease today actually led to a rise in \n",
      "October and November federal funds futures contracts.  Market participants presumably \n",
      "interpreted the introduction of the commercial paper funding facility as potentially a \n",
      "substitute for further monetary policy accommodation at this time.  Obviously, this is an \n",
      "extremely fragile and dangerous environment.  I am struck by the feeble market \n",
      "response to the substantial escalations implemented over the past ten days.  These \n",
      "include expanding standing foreign exchange swap facilities’ capacity to $620 billion \n",
      "from $290 billion; expanding the TAF auction cycles to $900 billion from $150 billion; \n",
      "and proposing a major backstop for the commercial paper market.  With respect to the \n",
      "commercial paper market backstop facility, the market reaction today was generally \n",
      "positive, but market participants clearly want to know more in terms of the specifics, \n",
      "especially when the program will be up and operational.  Of course, I’m happy to take \n",
      "any questions. \n",
      " \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ll take any questions or comments at this point.  Since Bill \n",
      "has covered the financial area, are there any questions for him?  President Lacker. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Bill, you said you were struck by the feeble reaction of markets to \n",
      "expanding our credit programs? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.  The markets didn’t take as much solace as I would have hoped, given \n",
      "the degree of escalation of those provisions. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  So what would it have looked like for them to have taken much solace?  I \n",
      "mean, what prices and quantities would change? \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "5 of 30MR. DUDLEY.  Well, for example, I would expect that LIBOR–OIS spreads might narrow \n",
      "rather than widen.  I might expect that equity prices would have taken some comfort from our \n",
      "efforts.  So generally I think the reaction was somewhat disappointing, frankly. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Could it be that some fundamentals are going on there that market \n",
      "participants don’t view it as addressing? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, a fair point is that the Federal Reserve cannot by its actions solve the \n",
      "balance sheet constraints of the U.S. banking system.  The Federal Reserve by its actions cannot \n",
      "create capital for banks, and that’s obviously one of the problems at the core of what is going on in \n",
      "the financial system. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  I want to ask you about the LIBOR spread.  It’s pretty striking, but I’m \n",
      "wondering, Do you have data on the quantity of borrowing that’s going on in that market and what \n",
      "that LIBOR figure really represents?  We have a bank in our District that reports on the LIBOR \n",
      "panel but reports borrowing at 100 to 150 basis points below it. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  The LIBOR panel may understate the pressure on funding costs for some \n",
      "banks.  But if you remember, the way the LIBOR is calculated, it actually is a truncated sample size.  \n",
      "They throw out the highs, and they throw out the lows.  They get the median of people in that \n",
      "market.  Also, other measures, such as the New York NYFR, have actually tended to be elevated \n",
      "relative to LIBOR, and the FX swap rate— the all-in basis for dollar funding in the FX swap \n",
      "market— has actually been elevated relative to LIBOR.  So I think that what we’re seeing in the \n",
      "LIBOR market is a pretty fair indication of the strains in term funding markets. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  In that LIBOR panel, there are places where you can get individual banks’ \n",
      "reports.  I haven’t looked in a week, but the last time I looked, the spread between the bottom bank \n",
      "and the top bank was over 150 basis points. \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "6 of 30MR. DUDLEY.  I think the reality right now is that LIBOR does not mean very much \n",
      "because there’s very little term funding going on at all.  So I think that there are rates that are posted \n",
      "in LIBOR, and they pull them off.  But you could argue that in some ways it’s even worse than the \n",
      "rate that is posted because, according to the reports that we’ve gotten, there’s just very little activity \n",
      "at term not just in the interbank market but in the broad array of markets. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Okay.  So the LIBOR–OIS spread may be misleading— not that sensitive \n",
      "an indicator.  If it goes up or down 50 basis points, we maybe shouldn’t read a lot into that. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I wouldn’t go quite that far.  Where it is today tells you that there’s \n",
      "significant strain.  I wouldn’t say that, if it goes up 10 basis points tomorrow or down 10 basis \n",
      "points tomorrow, I would conclude that the strains had lessened. \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  That is what I was getting at. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  President Lockhart.  \n",
      "MR. LOCKHART.  Bill, how would you interpret yesterday’s size of the TAF auction? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the escalation in the size of the TAF auction was obviously quite \n",
      "significant, and I think that it tells you two things:  Maybe there are limits to the demand for term \n",
      "funding, and maybe it represents a constraint in terms of collateral pledged at the discount window, \n",
      "especially given the fact that we announced the auction on Monday morning and the auction \n",
      "happened Monday afternoon.  So it is very possible that there was a bit of a lag in terms of the \n",
      "ability to mobilize collateral or take advantage of that auction capacity.  I thought it was actually \n",
      "pretty well subscribed.  I think it was $130-something billion in bids for $150 billion of available \n",
      "credit.  So in retrospect, I think that it was sized about right. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Let’s go on now and hear from Larry Slifman and \n",
      "Nathan Sheets. \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "7 of 30MR. SLIFMAN.  Let me first talk a bit about the near-term outlook.  Most of the \n",
      "economic data that we’ve gotten since the September Greenbook have come in to the \n",
      "soft side of our expectations.  The PCE number for August was surprisingly weak.  Auto \n",
      "sales dropped sharply in September.  Shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods \n",
      "fell in August, and in the labor market, as you know, private payrolls fell about 168,000 \n",
      "in September.  In addition, the Boeing strike is going to last longer than we thought at \n",
      "the time of the September Greenbook, and the hurricane effects from Hurricanes Gustaf \n",
      "and Ike appear to be more substantial in terms of the production adjustments than we \n",
      "had been thinking at the time of the September Greenbook.  So all told, we now expect \n",
      "GDP to be about unchanged in the second half of the year, and that’s down about ¾ \n",
      "percentage point since the last Greenbook. \n",
      " \n",
      "In terms of the medium-term outlook, 2009-10, we’ve had important changes in \n",
      "some of the conditioning assumptions that we see as working through so-called \n",
      "conventional channels.  As of this afternoon’s close, the stock market is down about \n",
      "20 percent since the September Greenbook.  Corporate bond rates are up about 90 basis \n",
      "points, and the dollar is up about 3 percent since the last Greenbook.  One good bit of \n",
      "news is that oil prices are down about $13 per barrel since we put the September \n",
      "Greenbook to bed.  Of course, financial stress has greatly intensified.  Using our usual \n",
      "method, which we described in the box in Part 1 of the Greenbook, we now think that \n",
      "the intensification of financial stress since the September Greenbook would subtract \n",
      "nearly 1 percentage point from real GDP growth in 2009.  The stock market has clearly \n",
      "been a moving target for us as we’ve been trying to put this all together and assess the \n",
      "outlook for next year and 2010.  But using this afternoon’s close as the starting point, \n",
      "real GDP now is projected to rise only about ½ percent over the four quarters of 2009 \n",
      "and then to pick up to an increase of about 2½ percent in 2010.  With that growth rate, \n",
      "we would have the unemployment rate rising to about 7¼ percent by the end of 2009, \n",
      "and we would expect it to remain at about that level through 2010. \n",
      " \n",
      "In terms of inflation, the recent data on core inflation pushed up our estimate of core \n",
      "PCE price inflation in the third quarter to more than 3 percent.  That’s about 0.2 \n",
      "percentage point higher than in the September Greenbook, but we expect that to ease \n",
      "back off in the fourth quarter and come down to a rate of about 2½ percent.  For the \n",
      "medium term, core inflation is expected to slow over the remainder of the forecast \n",
      "period.  We think that the pass-through from import and energy prices will abate, and of \n",
      "course, the additional slack that we now have in the forecast also could relieve some \n",
      "pressure on inflation.  In terms of the overall inflation rate, we expect energy and food \n",
      "price increases to taper off, and so we would see PCE price inflation slowing to about \n",
      "the same rate as core inflation.  Specifically, we would see inflation at about 2 percent in \n",
      "2009 and about 1.7 percent in 2010.  Nathan now has a few comments he wants to add. \n",
      " \n",
      "MR. SHEETS.  Since the last Greenbook, the economic indicators for the foreign \n",
      "economies have generally surprised us on the downside, notwithstanding the fact that \n",
      "our expectations in the Greenbook for foreign growth were already pretty grim.  In the \n",
      "euro area, measures of consumer and business sentiment have continued to retreat.  \n",
      "Industrial production has moved down, and retail sales have been soft.  Recent data for \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "8 of 30the United Kingdom have continued to point to a mild contraction during the second \n",
      "half of this year, and notably house prices there continue to fall.  In Japan, industrial \n",
      "production plummeted in August, recording its biggest monthly decline in more than \n",
      "five years, and survey data point to further declines in business and consumer \n",
      "confidence.  Finally, in the emerging market economies, industrial production has fallen \n",
      "in a broad set of countries, and exports have softened significantly. \n",
      " \n",
      "In light of these data, we now see foreign growth in the second half of this year as \n",
      "likely to come in at a little less than 1½ percent, down ½ percentage point from our last \n",
      "forecast, with these markdowns spread about evenly between the advanced economies \n",
      "and the emerging market economies.  We have reduced our projections for growth in \n",
      "2009 almost as much.  This weakening outlook for global activity has been largely \n",
      "driven, as Bill has described, by a marked deterioration in financial conditions in both \n",
      "the advanced and the emerging market economies.  Since the last FOMC meeting, \n",
      "equity markets have fallen sharply in numerous countries.  Risk premiums on many \n",
      "types of assets have risen, and conditions in short-term funding markets have worsened \n",
      "further.  These difficult financial conditions threaten the outlook for foreign growth \n",
      "going forward both by weighing on sentiment in financial markets and by potentially \n",
      "limiting the flow of credit to the economy. \n",
      " \n",
      "If there is any good news for me to report, it’s that the softening outlook for global \n",
      "growth has continued to put downward pressure on the price of oil and other \n",
      "commodities.  Oil prices have been extraordinarily volatile over the last month, lurching \n",
      "up and down in response to a number of factors, including the effects of the two \n",
      "hurricanes, shifting expectations regarding global growth, and financial turbulence.  On \n",
      "net, as Larry mentioned, the price of WTI is down about $13 a barrel since the \n",
      "Greenbook and down over $55 per barrel from its peak in mid-July.  Prices for many \n",
      "nonfuel commodities have fallen sharply since the FOMC meeting, including price \n",
      "declines of more than 10 percent for copper, nickel, and rubber, and more than \n",
      "20 percent for corn and soybeans.  Headline inflation remains elevated in the advanced \n",
      "foreign economies.  Notably, U.K. inflation in August reached 4¾ percent, a 15-year \n",
      "high.  In contrast, the most recent CPI data for the euro area hint at some deceleration, \n",
      "with inflation moving down from over 4 percent in July to 3.6 percent in September.  \n",
      "Going forward, there are good reasons to expect inflation in these economies to abate, \n",
      "given the recent sharp decline in commodity prices and emerging slack in their \n",
      "economies.  Inflation rates in the emerging market economies appear to be cresting for \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Bill, do you want to tackle that? \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Sure.  I think those figures are the right order of magnitude.  I looked at \n",
      "some figures today that, based on reasonable assumptions, you might expect the balance sheet to \n",
      "grow to a high of $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion by the end of the year.  Obviously, it depends on what \n",
      "assumptions you make about the amount of TAF credit that is actually drawn down and the amount \n",
      "of swaps that are actually drawn down.  But it could be that order of magnitude, and that would be \n",
      "exceptional.  That’s why getting interest-on-reserves authority was very, very important.  As Brian \n",
      "has said in earlier briefings, interest on reserves is going to start on Thursday, and that’s going to \n",
      "place a floor on the federal funds rate.  So we think we’re in a situation where we have a very \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions?  All right.  If not, let me just say \n",
      "a few words.  I will be brief.  It’s more than obvious that we have an extraordinary situation.  It is \n",
      "not a single market.  It’s not like the 1987 stock market crash or the 1970 commercial paper crisis.  \n",
      "Virtually all the markets—p articularly the credit markets— are not functioning or are in extreme \n",
      "stress.  It’s really an extraordinary situation, and I think everyone can agree that it’s creating \n",
      "enormous risks for the global economy. \n",
      "What to do about it?  The exchange we just had suggests that we may have disagreements \n",
      "about the benefits of liquidity provision.  I personally think that it has been helpful.  But I think we \n",
      "can agree that it is obviously not a panacea because, as the Vice Chairman points out, it doesn’t \n",
      "address the underlying capital issues.  That suggests that the right solutions probably have a \n",
      "significant fiscal element to them.  However, one feature of the last few days is how striking, how \n",
      "uncoordinated, and how erratic some of the fiscal approaches have been—particularly in Europe, \n",
      "where there has been a remarkable lack of coordination in the European Union.  So the fiscal \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "12 of 30solutions are coming, but they’re not there yet, and it is going to be a while.  We need greater clarity \n",
      "on those issues.  We had a meeting today on the Treasury’s authority, and they are hoping in the \n",
      "next few weeks to begin to provide greater clarity, which will be very helpful.  But I think that, if we \n",
      "can find some kind of bridge, it would be helpful, and that’s what this meeting is about. \n",
      "Although the financial markets are the dramatic element of the situation, I think we can \n",
      "make a case for easing policy today on the macro outlook, as given by Larry and Nathan.  I won’t \n",
      "go into detail.  I think it’s fairly clear.  You look first at inflation, and you see the remarkable decline \n",
      "in commodity prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and the decline in breakevens.  The 10-year \n",
      "breakeven this morning was about 1.35.  Of course, that could be a noisy indicator, but certainly it’s \n",
      "quite low.  I would say that, in terms of activity and the relation to inflation, we don’t have to rely \n",
      "on any flat Phillips curves here.  We have a global slowdown, and the implications for commodity \n",
      "prices are first order for our inflation forecast.  It is never safe to declare inflation under complete \n",
      "control, and I certainly don’t claim that no risks are there; but clearly the outlook for inflation is not \n",
      "looking nearly so threatening as it may have in the past. \n",
      "On the economic growth side, what is particularly worrisome to me is that, before this latest \n",
      "upsurge in financial stress, we had already seen deceleration in growth, including the declines, for \n",
      "example, in consumer spending.  Everyone I know who has looked at it— outside forecasters and \n",
      "the Greenbook producers here at the Board—believes that the financial stress we are seeing now is \n",
      "going to have a significant additional effect on growth.  Larry gave some estimates of \n",
      "unemployment above 7 percent for a couple of years.  So even putting aside the extraordinary \n",
      "conditions in financial markets, I think the macro outlook has shifted decisively toward output risks \n",
      "and away from inflation risks, and on that basis, I think that a policy move is justified. \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "13 of 30I should say that this comes as a surprise to me.  I very much expected that we could stay at \n",
      "2 percent for a long time, and then when the economy began to recover, we could begin to \n",
      "normalize interest rates.  But clearly things have gone off in a direction that is quite worrisome.  \n",
      "One could legitimately ask questions about the transmission mechanism under these conditions, and \n",
      "I think those are good questions.  But first it seems to me that we can, to some extent, offset costs of \n",
      "credit through our actions, even if spreads are wide.  Second, to the extent that the global \n",
      "coordination creates some more optimism about the future of the global economy, we may see some \n",
      "improvements in credit spreads.  We may not, but it seems to me that this is the right direction in \n",
      "which to go. \n",
      "Despite everything that’s happening, I might not be bringing this to you at this point, except \n",
      "that we have the opportunity to move jointly with five other major central banks, and I think the \n",
      "coordination and cooperation is a very important element of this proposal.  First of all, again, I \n",
      "mentioned before the lurching and the lack of coordination among fiscal authorities and other \n",
      "governments.  I think it would be extraordinarily helpful to confidence to show that the world \n",
      "central banks are working closely together, have a similar view of global economic conditions, and \n",
      "are willing to take strong actions to address those conditions.  I think that there is a multiplier effect, \n",
      "if you will.  Our move, along with these other moves, will have a stronger effect on the global \n",
      "economy and on the U.S. economy than our acting alone.  Moving together has other benefits.  Just \n",
      "to note one, we can have less concern about the dollar if we’re all moving together and less concern \n",
      "about inflation expectations given that all the banks are moving and all see the same problem. \n",
      "There is a tactical issue.  I think the real key to this is actually the European Central Bank.  \n",
      "They have had some difficulty coming to the realization that Europe would be under a great deal of \n",
      "stress and was not going to be decoupled from the United States.  They made an important \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "14 of 30rhetorical step at their last meeting to open the way for a potential cut, but I think that this \n",
      "coordinated action gives them an opportunity to get out of the corner into which they are somewhat \n",
      "painted and their move will have a big impact on global expectations about policy responsiveness.  \n",
      "So, again, I think the coordination is a very important part of this. \n",
      "I want to say once again that I don’t think that monetary policy is going to solve this \n",
      "problem.  I don’t think liquidity policy is going to solve this problem.  I think the only way out of \n",
      "this is fiscal and perhaps some regulatory and other related policies.  But we don’t have that yet.  \n",
      "We’re working toward that.  We are in a very serious situation.  So it seems to me that there is a \n",
      "case for moving now in an attempt to provide some reassurance— it may or may not do so— but in \n",
      "any case, to try to do what we can to make a bridge toward the broader approach to the crisis. \n",
      "So that’s my recommendation, that we join the other central banks in a 50 basis point move \n",
      "before markets open tomorrow morning.  If we proceed in that direction, there are, as I mentioned, \n",
      "two statements.  Brian, do the Presidents have the joint statement? \n",
      "MR. MADIGAN.  They do not. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  I’m going to read the joint statement by central \n",
      "banks, which has been negotiated with the other central banks.  So we really can’t edit this one \n",
      "because of the negotiations that have already taken place.  However, you should already have the \n",
      "FOMC statement.  So here’s the joint statement by central banks: \n",
      "“Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close \n",
      "consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to \n",
      "reduce strains in financial markets.  Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of \n",
      "countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices.  Inflation \n",
      "expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability.  The recent intensification of \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "15 of 30the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the \n",
      "upside risks to price stability.  Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted.  \n",
      "Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal \n",
      "Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in \n",
      "policy interest rates.  The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions.”  \n",
      "So that would be the joint statement.  Then we would issue separately on our website the \n",
      "FOMC statement.  Let me stop there and open the floor for comments on the action, on the general \n",
      "situation, on the statement, or whatever you would like to talk about.  Would anyone like to speak?  \n",
      "President Yellen. \n",
      "MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly support your proposal to cut the \n",
      "federal funds rate by 50 basis points today and the wording of the statement.  I’m pleased that the \n",
      "FOMC will take this step as part of a coordinated program with other central banks.  In my opinion, \n",
      "a larger action could easily be justified and is ultimately likely to prove necessary.  We’re \n",
      "witnessing a complete breakdown in the functioning of credit markets, and it is affecting every class \n",
      "of borrowers.  The financial developments are dangerous and are having a pronounced impact on \n",
      "the economic outlook.  The outlook has deteriorated very sharply, and even so, I still see the risks to \n",
      "the downside.  Moreover, recent data on consumer and capital spending and on housing confirm \n",
      "that a sharp contraction in domestic demand is under way.  As far as I’m concerned, for the reasons \n",
      "you gave, inflation risks have diminished markedly.  Indeed, in a contraction as severe as that which \n",
      "is now on the horizon, I anticipate that inflation will decline noticeably below my own estimate of \n",
      "price stability.  I think the Board has taken a wide array of creative and massive actions to provide \n",
      "liquidity to the credit markets.  I think these are very appropriate and necessary.  I hope we will do \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "16 of 30more, but they are not completely a substitute for cutting the federal funds rate.  I think that’s an \n",
      "important complement to the liquidity actions. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner, you had a two-hander? \n",
      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I just wanted to point out that I have assembled a historic \n",
      "coalition in New York of hawks on both sides of me today in support of your proposal.  They have \n",
      "agreed to join me here in New York as a gesture of support for your proposal. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Somebody send me a photograph. \n",
      "MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, we enjoy visiting Third World countries.  [Laughter] \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  We just thought we would outflank him, but we haven’t succeeded. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t know where to go from there.  [Laughter]  Are there \n",
      "any other comments?  President Plosser. \n",
      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d just like to make a couple of observations \n",
      "and perhaps ask a question and make maybe one observation about language.  As a general \n",
      "proposition, I do not like intermeeting cuts.  I think they signal more panic than they do stability.  \n",
      "On the other hand, I think this is an opportunity, given what the other central banks are doing, that \n",
      "might prove to be an exception to that.  So I am reluctantly or modestly comfortable with this, \n",
      "however you want to characterize it, because I don’t think that anything that we do today—c utting \n",
      "the funds rate 50 basis points or whatever— is going to make the next couple of months in terms of \n",
      "the overall economy any less painful.  They won’t be felt in the real economy for some time to \n",
      "come.  They may provide some solace to the markets.  I hope that they will.  I wouldn’t bet the \n",
      "ranch on that, but I do think that the coordinated effort might be helpful.  I like in the statement the \n",
      "stressing of the point that, as you put it, this is based on a deteriorating economic outlook, and I \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "17 of 30think it is very important that we continue to emphasize that point as opposed to just volatility in the \n",
      "financial markets.  So I feel that’s very helpful. \n",
      "I have one question.  President Yellen alluded to this, and I would like your thoughts on this, \n",
      "Mr. Chairman.  Obviously, as we have been experiencing over the last year, things have seemed to \n",
      "change very rapidly at times, sometimes in surprising ways and in ways that we couldn’t anticipate.  \n",
      "But I have stressed in past meetings the importance for us of thinking not just about a funds rate \n",
      "decision on any given day or at any given meeting but about what we think the path should look \n",
      "like.  So rather than just considering our action today, we obviously have a scheduled meeting \n",
      "coming up in a few weeks.  Do you think that this is the precursor, as President Yellen suggested, to \n",
      "perhaps additional cuts, and where do you think a likely path might take us going forward, given \n",
      "that this is an intermeeting cut?   \n",
      "My last comment has to do with the language, and I’d just like to make an observation about \n",
      "the sentence on inflation.  It reads, “Inflation has been high, but the Committee believes that the \n",
      "decline in energy and other commodity prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have \n",
      "materially reduced the upside risks to inflation.”  I guess I would make two observations, Mr. \n",
      "Chairman.  One, that seems to be a much stronger statement about the reduction in the prospects for \n",
      "inflation than actually you gave in your speech today, where you emphasized that it had been \n",
      "reduced but that there continues to be lots of uncertainty and inflation continues to need monitoring.  \n",
      "I would put on the table for discussion that we change the phrase “materially reduced” to these \n",
      "things have “mitigated near-term upside risks to inflation.”  Clearly commodity and oil prices have \n",
      "both mitigated the expectational channel for inflation in the near term.  But I’m not necessarily \n",
      "convinced— and it’s very model dependent— as to what inflation might do in the latter part of ’09 \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "18 of 30and so forth.  So I think that we should emphasize that the inflation risks for the near term have been \n",
      "mitigated as our rationale there.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  To respond to your question, I am not planning any particular \n",
      "action at the regular meeting at this point or any particular recommendation.  Obviously, given how \n",
      "quickly things are changing, the world could be very different then from the way it is now.  I think \n",
      "this is a good opportunity to move with the other central banks, as you mentioned. \n",
      "Thinking about funds rate paths, we all have to be aware that we are, in fact, now at a very \n",
      "low level, and there are serious questions about the functioning of markets and the economy at \n",
      "extraordinary low levels of interest rates.  So that constraint is going to be an issue, and it will affect \n",
      "our decision as we think about it.  But I feel rather unconfident about predicting the path of rates six \n",
      "months in the future because I’m not quite sure what is going to happen tomorrow at this point.  Let \n",
      "me turn to President Stern. \n",
      "MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support reducing the funds rate target 50 basis \n",
      "points and doing it now.  I think we ought to take advantage of the situation that has arisen with \n",
      "regard to coordinated action with other central banks.  That seems to me to be important and \n",
      "appropriate at this point, given the extraordinary circumstances that we confront. \n",
      "I’d just make a couple of other comments.  Larry Slifman marked down the economic \n",
      "outlook for the next several quarters for sure and I guess longer than that.  If I were doing my \n",
      "forecast today, I would mark down the near-term outlook even more.  It seems to me that the \n",
      "restraints on the economy together with the nature of the incoming evidence suggest that the near-\n",
      "term outlook at least is not terribly promising— not that we can do very much about that, of course.  \n",
      "But I think maybe more important, I have been one who for some time thought that it was likely that \n",
      "inflation would diminish relatively quickly.  That apparently isn’t going to happen or didn’t happen \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "19 of 30in the third quarter as measured by core, but the incoming evidence both nationally and globally \n",
      "suggests to me that inflation risks have diminished.  I’ve expected that to be the case.  It seems to be \n",
      "unwinding in that fashion.  Obviously I didn’t anticipate the path of commodity prices and the stress \n",
      "in the financial markets to the degree that it has occurred, but they only reinforce my confidence that \n",
      "inflation, in fact, will run lower from here.  Thank you. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans. \n",
      "MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to say that your own commentary \n",
      "touched on almost all the issues that I had in front of me.  I can support this action.  I’m not sure it’s \n",
      "the ideal time, but I can certainly support this.  I agree with you that I think inflationary pressures \n",
      "will be coming down.  I think that we’re looking at significant resource slack.  Commodity prices \n",
      "are coming down, and the prospects for growth are not good at all.  I think the only thing keeping us \n",
      "from calling this a recession is the official people who are in charge of doing that. \n",
      "I don’t want you to misinterpret my question about our balance sheet and the size of what \n",
      "we’re extending to the markets when I asked about $3 trillion when I added in the Treasury \n",
      "proposal.  Clearly there is a lot of financial stress out there, and I think that we’re facing a very \n",
      "substantial credit crunch of unusual proportions.  I agree that these facilities are attempting to \n",
      "unlock the lending capacity, as Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned.  I think that’s extremely \n",
      "helpful.  I just have concerns— these are very, very large, unprecedented actions— and I’m sure that \n",
      "everybody else shares them as well.  I’m reasonably confident that there’s adequate risk \n",

      "I’d say that what appears now in financial markets is that the thesis we’ve been talking about— that \n",
      "this is significantly about housing— seems to some extent overcome by events.  I think the best way \n",
      "to view financial markets is to say that what’s fundamentally going on is a reassessment of the value \n",
      "of every asset everywhere in the world, and what might have been triggered by housing has \n",
      "certainly gone beyond that.  That forces us and market participants alike to think about the mix of \n",
      "policy responses, not principally or not just from the Federal Reserve. \n",
      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "26 of 30Second, on the economy, I suspect that it will be increasingly hard to find decouplers, and I \n",
      "suspect that the real economic problems in Europe and among the advanced foreign economies are \n",
      "likely to be more real, deeper, and harder for them and their economies to respond to than ours.  So \n",
      "as Nathan suggests, that makes the policy decisions they have over the coming months and our \n",
      "ability to count on a global recovery even more suspect. \n",
      "Third, on the policy front, in thinking about this as a global, synchronized rate cut it strikes \n",
      "me that the first two words of that phrase are far more important than the last two and that the focus \n",
      "on global, synchronized action is an important symbol to markets not just here but abroad—that the \n",
      "world’s central banks and policy action are very focused and that all of us will do whatever it takes \n",
      "to try to make sure that the real economy and financial markets respond more positively.  So I take \n",
      "your judgment, Mr. Chairman, that this is the right time— to take advantage of the action of a host \n",
      "of central banks; and I’ll join the realistic expectations crowd in thinking that we shouldn’t oversell \n",
      "what’s the likely policy response.  \n",
      "In terms of the statement itself, I would be comfortable with the statement as written but \n",
      "would have a preference to dropping “materially” as you suggest.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  With the intermeeting move that we had back in \n",
      "January— 10 months ago, which now of course seems like 10 years ago— we spoke a lot about the \n",

      "nonlinear movement between the two.  Unfortunately, over the past few weeks we’ve seen some \n",
      "evidence of that nonlinear shift, both in the real economy and in financial markets.  In particular, \n",
      "we’re seeing that globally— we are seeing a very, very sharp change internationally in growth \n",

      "October 7, 2008\n",
      "27 of 30the problems in the financial markets, as mentioned by a number of participants, is the concern \n",
      "about insufficient capital.  Well, one reason for the concerns about insufficient capital and the \n",
      "heightening of those concerns is what losses are going to be faced.  Obviously the real economy has \n",
      "to do with how the housing market is going to evolve, which has to do with wealth, which has to do \n",

      "some of that macroeconomic tail risk.  We are seeing reasonable evidence that we’re shifting into a \n",
      "contraction regime, if you will, rather than a growth regime.  I think we were fighting hard against \n",
      "that with our earlier rate cuts and with our liquidity facilities.  I think we were able to hold that shift \n",
      "at bay for a while.  But now we have some evidence that we’ve moved into this other regime, and I \n",

      "\n",
      "I recently had the chance to peruse a paper centered on Artificial Intelligence and, as an individual deeply entrenched in my spiritual beliefs and values, I found myself viewing the content with a fair degree of apprehension and introspection. \n",
      "\n",
      "The authors of the paper put forth an undoubtedly commendable effort in the exploration of AI, its functions, implications, and potential impact on human society. They demonstrated an impressive depth of research, technical dexterity, and academic prowess. However, from my religious viewpoint, I felt unease and resistance towards the idea that machines, created and programmed by humans, could potentially equal or surpass their creators in levels of intelligence or decision-making capacities.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a God-centered perspective, the ability to create, think, and act with free will is a divine gift, a facet of what makes us humans unique and distinct from all other creations. The concept that these distinctive human traits could be synthetically replicated, with the goal of creating beings that could match or exceed the innate complexities of human intelligence, strikes me not only as impossibly ambitious but also ethically questionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors numerously discuss the intricate tapestry of AI without substantial inclusion of ethical considerations or the spiritual implications of creating sentient machines, which felt like a glaring omission. As a religious person, I believe the power of creation in the likeness of human intelligence belongs only to God, and for humans to claim this power could be seen as tantamount to blasphemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attempting to replicate God's creation through technological advancement, while indeed a testament to human innovation, can be viewed as an overreaching attempt to rewrite what has been divinely designed. This view of artificial intelligence as an affront to our religious ethos may not resonate with everyone, certainly not with those who hold divergent views. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, it is vital to recognize the variety of views and the potential conflict between advancing technology and established religious principles. It would, therefore, be beneficial if the authors could broaden their perspective to include an examination of these ethical and theological issues surrounding AI, providing a balanced viewpoint that crosses the divide between technological advancement and spiritual belief. \n",
      "\n",
      "This review is far from an outright rejection of the study presented in the paper, as it sheds light on the AI field impressively. It is merely a call for deeper reflection on the implications and how they intersect with faith, a topic that holds enormous weight and importance for so many around the globe.\n"
